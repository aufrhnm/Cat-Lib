## Lesson 1: The Purpose of Man's Existence `(Mục đích Tồn tại của Con người)`

### Q. 1. Who made us?

**A.** God made us.

- Reason unaided by revelation can prove that God exists. It knows that this vast universe could not have come into being by its own powers. The movement of creatures and their dependence upon one another, the various degrees of perfection found in them, the fact that they come into being and cease to be, and, finally, the marvelous order in the universe, demand the existence of an almighty power and the wisdom of an eternal intelligent cause that we call God.

> `"In the beginning God created heaven and earth ... And God created man to his own image" (Genesis 1:1, Genesis 1:27).`

> `"God, who made the world and all that is in it ... from one man he has created the whole human race" (Acts 17:24-26).`

### Q. 2. Who is God?

**A.** God is the Supreme Being, infinitely perfect, who made all things and keeps them in existence.

- This universe did not always exist; it came into existence at the beginning of time. All things depend on God; they begin and continue to exist by the power of God.

> `"Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised, and his greatness is unsearchable" (Psalm 144:3).`

> `"It is he who gives to all men life and breath and all things" (Acts 17:25).`

> `"In him we live and move and have our being" (Acts 17:28).`

### Q. 3. Why did God make us?

**A.** God made us to show forth His goodness and to share with us His everlasting happiness in heaven.

- By creating the world God did not increase His own happiness, since He was infinitely happy from all eternity, but He did manifest His glory externally by sharing His goodness. All creatures by their very existence show forth the glory of God, for all depend on God for their existence.
    
- God created man to manifest His glory in a special way. He gave man an intellect and a will that he might know, praise, and love his Creator. In the service of God man finds his true, though imperfect, happiness in this life. Perfect happiness has been promised in the next life as a reward for the merits man acquires here on earth. Thus, the happiness of man is also a purpose of creation.
    
- The happiness of heaven consists in the direct vision, love, and enjoyment of God. This reward so far exceeds man's nature that without the supernatural help of God it could not possibly be attained. In heaven God gives us the light of glory, which enables us to see Him face to face. During our life on earth God gives us His grace, which enables us to live a supernatural life and to perform the actions that can earn this reward.
    
- The happiness of the blessed in heaven varies according to the merits of their lives on earth. All in heaven are perfectly happy, but one person may have a greater degree of happiness than another because he has more capacity for happiness, by reason of a more virtuous life on earth.
    

> `"The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament proclaims the work of his hands" (Psalm 18:2).`

> `"He set his eye upon their hearts to show them the greatness of his works: That they might praise the name which he hath sanctified, and glory in his wondrous acts: that they might declare the glorious things of his works" (Ecclesiasticus 17:7-8).`

> `"And every one that calleth upon my name, I have created him for my glory: I have formed him and made him" (Isaias 43:7).`

> `"For the Son of Man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will render to everyone according to his conduct" (Matthew 16:27).`

> `"What does it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, but suffer the loss of his own soul?" (Mark 8:36).`

> `"In my Father's house there are many mansions" (John 14:2).`

> `"Eye has not seen nor ear heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man, what things God has prepared for those who love him" (1 Corinthians 2:9).`

> `"Now he who plants and he who waters are one, yet each will receive his own reward according to his labor" (1 Corinthians 3:8).`

> `"We see now through a mirror in an obscure manner, but then face to face" (1 Corinthians 13:12).`

### Q. 4. What must we do to gain the happiness of heaven?

**A.** To gain the happiness of heaven we must know, love, and serve God in this world.

- Man must know, love, and serve God in a supernatural manner in order to gain the happiness of heaven. Man is raised to the supernatural order only by grace, a free gift of God.
    
- Man cannot be perfectly happy in this world, for nothing created can satisfy his desire for complete happiness. History and experience show that neither riches, nor honors, nor glory, nor reputation, nor power, nor pleasure, nor knowledge, nor any other worldly goods can fully satisfy man's longing for happiness.
    
- Man's earthly, imperfect happiness is in proportion to his approach to God-the final goal of his life. The more closely man approaches God by the practice of virtue under the influence of God's grace, the greater will be his happiness. Worldly goods and pleasures may satisfy man for a time, but of themselves they cannot make him fully happy. Man may enjoy the innocent pleasures and reasonable comforts of life as long as they do not lead him away from God.
    

> `"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter the kingdom of heaven; but he who does the will of my Father in heaven shall enter the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 7:21).`

> `"And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole mind, and with thy whole strength" (Mark 12:30).`

> `"If you love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15).`

> `"Now this is everlasting life, that they may know thee, the only true God, and him whom thou hast sent, Jesus Christ" (John 17:3).`

### Q. 5. From whom do we learn to know, love, and serve God?

**A.** We learn to know, love, and serve God from Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who teaches us through the Catholic Church.

- In order to be saved, all persons who have attained the use of reason must believe explicitly that God exists and that He rewards the good and punishes the wicked; in practice they must also believe explicitly in the mysteries of the Blessed Trinity and the Incarnation.
    
- The supernatural happiness of heaven and such mysteries as the Holy Trinity, the Incarnation, and the Redemption are beyond anything man can know by his unaided powers of reason; they can be learned only through God's revelation.
    

> `"All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and behold, I am with you all days, even unto the consummation of the world" (Matthew 28:18-20).`

> `"He who hears you, hears me" (Luke 10:16).`

> `"And without faith it is impossible to please God. For he who comes to God must believe that God exists and is a rewarder to those who seek him" (Hebrews 11:6).`

### Q. 6. Where do we find the chief truths taught by Jesus Christ through the Catholic Church?

**A.** We find the chief truths taught by Jesus Christ through the Catholic Church in the Apostles' Creed.

- A creed is a summary of the principal articles of faith. Since the Church received Christ's mandate to teach His way of salvation to all men in all ages, it was necessary to formulate at least the most important doctrines. To preserve unity of faith, it was first necessary to have the belief itself quite clearly stated. Thus, there are records from the earliest times of a set profession of faith required of converts before their Baptism.
    
- With the spread of Christianity various erroneous teachings regarding the doctrines of faith were proclaimed. It thus became necessary to define the truths of revelation more explicitly. The Apostles' Creed underwent modification, not by the introduction of new doctrines but by an expression of the traditional belief in terms that left no room for error or misunderstanding. The principal creeds of the Church are the Apostles' Creed, the Athanasian Creed, and the Nicene Creed.
    

### Q. 7. What are the words of the Apostles' Creed.

**A.** I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, Our Lord; who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended into hell; the third day He arose again from the dead; He ascended into heaven, sitteth at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.

- This collection of revealed truths is called the "Apostles' Creed" because it contains a summary of the principal truths handed down by the apostles and was in use from the earliest ages as the mark of a Christian.
    
- The twelve articles of the Creed contain the mystery of one God in three distinct Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and the operations that are, for a particular reason, attributed to each Person.
    
- In the three main parts of the Apostles' Creed the doctrine of the mystery of the Trinity is so set forth that the first part tells of the first Person and the work of creation; the next, of the second Person and the work of redemption; and the third, of the third Person and the work of our sanctification, begun on earth by grace and completed in heaven by glory.
    

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT THE PURPOSE OF MAN'S EXISTENCE

- No human being can live properly unless he knows the purpose of life. The present lesson tells us this purpose. We have been created by God in order to glorify Him and to merit eternal happiness with Him in heaven. Our own reason tells us that we have a spiritual soul; and a spirit is immortal - that is, it will never die. Reason also assures us that we can find perfect happiness only in God, for the desire for happiness in every human heart is unlimited, and hence no created good can fully satisfy it. As St. Augustine said: "The heart of man is made for Thee, O God, and it is restless till it rests in Thee."
    
- God has revealed to us that the happiness to which He invites us in the next life is a share of His own happiness. It consists in seeing God directly in all His goodness and beauty, in loving Him, and in enjoying His presence for all eternity. This happiness, which is called the beatific vision, is a privilege to which human beings naturally have no strict right. It is true that, because of the spiritual and immortal nature of our soul, we have a right to everlasting happiness in the life to come if we serve God faithfully in this world. We have no claim, however, to the supernatural possession of God such as is given in the beatific vision. In order to merit this supernatural happiness God gives us while we are on earth sufficient grace to live a supernatural life and to perform the actions necessary to earn this reward.
    
- The Sacred Scriptures, God's own word, frequently refer to the happiness prepared for us in heaven, and urge us to strive to attain it. God has called all men to this happiness, but some do not attain it because they commit mortal sin and die without repenting of it. These souls are cast into hell, and will never possess God. Hence, it is the most important duty of our lives to fulfill the conditions necessary to merit eternal happiness. These conditions are to know, to love, and to serve God in a supernatural manner.
    
- The first condition is to know God in a supernatural manner -that is, by faith. To do this we must learn the truths He has revealed to us and become familiar with the duties we owe Him. Without such a knowledge it is impossible to love and to serve God as we should. The most important of the truths He has revealed are four: 1) that God exists, 2) that He rewards the good and punishes the wicked, 3) that there are three Persons in the one God, and 4) that the Son of God became man and died for our salvation. However, we should not be content with knowing these four truths, but should study the doctrines of revelation.
    
- Catholics have no difficulty in knowing God in a supernatural manner, for the Catholic Church was established by Jesus Christ, the Son of God, to act as His representative in teaching men about God. The chief truths taught by Jesus Christ through the Catholic Church are found in the Apostles' Creed. There are also some important truths revealed by God which are not found in the Apostles' Creed, such as the Real Presence of Our Lord in the Holy Eucharist and the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Moreover, other Creeds besides the Apostles' Creed are used in the Church, particularly the Nicene Creed which is recited in the Mass; it was composed at the Council of Nicaea, in 325 A.D. There is also the Athanasian Creed, named after St. Athanasius, a bishop of the fourth century.
    
- Nowadays when it is so easy to procure books and pamphlets explaining the teachings of the Catholic Church, every Catholic able to read can acquire a thorough knowledge of the Catholic faith. Catholic programs on the radio are also a means of increasing our knowledge of the Church's teachings.
    
- Catholic boys and girls should strive to learn their lessons in Catechism faithfully and thoroughly. They should always remember that in studying their religion they are preparing themselves to gain the happiness of heaven, for they are fulfilling the first condition of meriting that happiness - to know God. They must remember, however, that the knowledge of God does not consist in merely reciting the answers of the Catechism by memory. They must try to grasp the meaning of these answers, and apply to their own lives the truths they contain.
    

### RESOLUTION:

- Resolve that during your entire life you will continue to study the truths of your Catholic religion, and thus by ever knowing God better and better, constantly prepare yourself for the happiness of heaven, which is the great goal of your life.

## Lesson 2: God and His Perfections `(Thiên Chúa và Sự Hoàn hảo của Ngài)`

> "I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER ALMIGHTY, CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH ..."

### Q. 8. What do we mean when we say that God is the Supreme Being?

**A.** When we say that God is the Supreme Being we mean that He is above all creatures, the self-existing and infinitely perfect Spirit.

- God is above all created things - the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms, men, and angels. Some likeness of God is in every creature, from the highest to the lowest. The highest angel, however, is but a weak reflection of the infinite perfection of God, who is the infinite Creator and Governor of the universe.

> `"I am who am" (Exodus 3:14).`

> `"I am the First, and I am the Last, and besides me there is no God" (Isaias 44:6).`

### Q. 9. What is a spirit?

**A.** A spirit is a being that has understanding and free will, but no body, and will never die.

- The soul of man is a spirit which does not die because it is simple, having no integral parts, and because it is spiritual, that is, entirely independent of matter in its being and in its own proper acts; it does not depend on creatures for existence and cannot be destroyed by them.

### Q. 10. What do we mean when we say that God is self-existing?

**A.** When we say that God is self-existing, we mean that He does not owe His existence to any other being.

- God is the first and completely independent source of all being. Every other being is given existence, God is His own existence; God is His own life, or He who is. It is a manifest contradiction to hold that God, who is self-existent, could have been brought into being by anyone else.

> *`See Scripture, question 8, Exodus 3:14.`*

### Q. 11. What do we mean when we say that God is infinitely perfect?

**A.** When we say that God is infinitely perfect, we mean that He has all perfections without limit.

- God has in Himself, in an eminent degree, the perfections of all things that ever existed or will or can exist. He is the cause of all perfection in creatures. The perfections of created things are in God in an infinitely superior manner.
    
- Every creature, even the highest angel, is finite for it has the limitation of dependence on the Creator for its existence.
    

> `"Great is the Lord ... and his greatness is unsearchable" (Psalm 144:3).`

### Q. 12. What are some of the perfections of God?

**A.** Some of the perfections of God are: God is eternal, all-good, all knowing, all-present, and almighty.

### Q. 13. What do we mean when we say that God is eternal?

**A.** When we say that God is eternal, we mean that He always was and always will be, and that He always remains the same.

- If God had a beginning or if He could cease to be, He would be limited and would not be infinitely perfect or self-existing. If God changed, the change would be either for the better or for the worse. In either case God would not be infinitely perfect.
    
- Spirits such as angels and the souls of men are eternal in the sense that they will live forever, but both angels and the souls of men, unlike God, had a beginning and are subject to change.
    

> `"Before the mountains were brought forth and the earth and the world were born, and from everlasting to everlasting thou art, O God" (Psalm 89:2).`

> `"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of Lights, with whom there is no change, nor shadow of alteration" (James 1:17).`

> `"'I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end,' says the Lord God, 'who is and who was and who is coming, the Almighty' " (Apocalypse 1:8).`

### Q. 14. What do we mean when we say that God is all-good?

**A.** When we say that God is all-good, we mean that He is infinitely lovable in Himself, and that from His fatherly love every good comes to us.

- Things are good and lovable in the degree that they are perfect. Since God is infinitely perfect, He is all-good and infinitely lovable in Himself, and all goodness of creatures must come from Him.

> `"With whose beauty, if they being delighted, took them to be gods: let them know how much the Lord of them is more beautiful than they. For the first author of beauty made all those things" (Wisdom 13:3).`

### Q. 15. What do we mean when we say that God is all-knowing?

**A.** When we say that God is all-knowing, we mean that He knows all things, past, present, and future, even our most secret thoughts, words, and actions.

- God's knowledge is not gained like ours, by proceeding step by step from things known to those unknown. By knowing Himself perfectly, God knows from eternity all things past, present, and future, and even all things possible. Every creature, in its actions, depends entirely on God, and any goodness in creatures is but an imperfect reflection of God's perfection. Through His infinitely perfect knowledge God knows the extent to which creatures share His perfections.
    
- God's knowledge of the future does not take away our freedom, but leaves our wills free to act or not to act.
    
- We are responsible for our free actions, which will be rewarded by God if they are good and punished by Him if they are evil.
    

> `"Before man is life and death, good and evil: that which he shall choose shall be given him" (Ecclesiasticus 15:18).`

> `"Who hath been tried thereby, and made perfect, he shall have glory everlasting. He that could have transgressed, and hath not transgressed: and could do evil things and hath not done them" ( 10).`

> `"The Lord knoweth all knowledge and hath beheld the signs of the world. He declareth the things that are past and the things that are to come, and revealeth the traces of hidden things" (Ecclesiasticus 42:19).`

> `"For I am God, and there is no god beside: neither is there the like to me" (Isaias 46:9).`

> `"And there is no creature hidden from his sight; but all things are naked and open to the eyes of him to whom we have to give account" (Hebrews 4:13).`

### Q. 16. What do we mean when we say that God is all-present?

**A.** When we say that God is all-present, we mean that He is everywhere.

- God is everywhere: first, by His power, inasmuch as all things are under His dominion; second, by His Presence. Inasmuch as nothing is hidden from Him; third, by His essence, inasmuch as He is in all things as the cause of their being.

> `"Whither may I go from thy spirit, or whither may I flee from thy face? If I ascend into heaven, thou art there; if I lie down with the dead, thou art present. If I lay hold of the wings of the dawn, if I dwell in the farthest part of the sea: Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me" (Psalm 138:7-10).`

### Q. 17. If God is everywhere, why do we not see Him?

**A.** Although God is everywhere, we do not see Him because He is a spirit and cannot be seen with our eyes.

- Although we cannot see God, the splendid order and beauty of creation should constantly remind us of His wisdom, His power, His goodness, and His nearness to us.

> `"God is spirit, and they who worship him must worship in spirit and in truth. (John 4:24).`

### Q. 18. Does God see us?

**A.** God sees us and watches over us with loving care.

> `"The eyes of the Lord in every place behold the good and the evil" (Proverbs 15:3).`

> `"And as for clothing, why are you anxious? Consider how the lilies of the field grow; they neither toil nor spin, yet I say to you that not even in all his glory was arrayed like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which flourishes today but tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more you, O you of little faith! Therefore, do not be anxious, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or, 'What shall we drink?' or, 'What are we to put on?' (For after all these things the Gentiles seek); for your Father knows that you need all these things" (Matthew 6:28-32).`

### Q. 19. What is God's loving care for us called?

**A.** God's loving care for us is called Divine Providence.

- Divine Providence is God's plan for guiding every creature to its proper end.

> `"All expect of thee, that thou give them food in season. What thou givest to them they gather up; when thou openest thy hand, they are filled with good. If thou hidest thy face, they are troubled; if thou takest away their breath, they die and return to their dust. If thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created, and thou renewest the face of the earth" (Psalm 103:27-30).`

> `"For God will not accept any man's person, neither will he stand in awe of any man's greatness: for he made the little and the great, and he hath equally care of all" (Wisdom 6:8).`

> `"Cast all your anxiety upon him, because he cares for you" (1 Peter 5:7).`

### Q. 20. What do we mean when we say that God is almighty?

**A.** When we say that God is almighty, we mean that He can do all things.

- God can do anything that is not opposed to His perfection, or that is not self-contradictory. The impossibility of God's doing anything wrong or acting falsely does not limit His divine power, since wrongdoing and falsity in themselves are evil and are manifest defects, they cannot be associated with an infinitely perfect Being.
    
- Although God, the first cause of all things, actually does all things, He does not thereby deprive the creature of its power of causality nor of its freedom of action. A creature is never more than a secondary cause, that is, always dependent on God, always a finite being. When this secondary cause is intellectual, it is constituted by Almighty God as a free agent.
    

> `"Whatsoever the Lord pleases, he does in heaven and on earth, in the sea, and in all the deeps" (Psalm 134:6).`

> `"How often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen gathers her young under her wings, but thou wouldst not!" (Matthew 23:37).`

> `"For nothing shall be impossible with God" (Luke 1:37).`

### Q. 21. Is God all-wise, all-holy, all-merciful, and all-just?

**A.** Yes, God is all-wise, all-holy, all-merciful, and all-just.

- God, the first cause of all things, in His wisdom knows these things perfectly and disposes them to their ends according to appropriate means.
    
- If we do not understand why or how God does certain things or permits them to happen, it is because our limited minds cannot understand His secrets nor see the universal plan of creation.
    
- Because God is all-holy, He is entirely free from all sin and imperfection and is infinitely good and lovable.
    
- Because God is all-merciful, He gives to each creature even more than is its due. He rewards the good more fully and punishes the wicked less severely than they deserve. He is always ready to help His creatures and to forgive repentant sinners.
    
- Because God is all-just, He gives to each creature what is due to it. God rewards the good and punishes the wicked partially in this life and more fully in eternity.
    

> `"Be ye holy, because I the Lord your God am holy" (Leviticus 19:2).`

> `"Thou art just, O Lord, and all thy judgments are just; and all thy ways mercy, and truth, and judgment" (Tobias 3:2).`

> `"The Lord is merciful and kind; slow to anger and plenteous in mercy" (Psalm 102:8).`

> `"The Lord is just in all his ways, and holy in all his works" (Psalm 144:17).`

> `"Of his wisdom there is no measure" (Psalm 146:5).`

> `"And they cried one to another, and said: Holy, Holy, Holy, the Lord God of hosts, all the earth is full of his glory" (Isaias 6:3).`

> `"Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God! How incomprehensible are his judgments and how unsearchable his ways!" (Romans 11:33).`

### Q. 22. Can we know by our natural reason that there is a God?

**A.** We can know by our natural reason that there is a God, for natural reason tells us that the world we see about us could have been made only by a self-existing Being, all-wise and almighty. 2

> *`See Scripture, question 3, Psalm 18:2.`*

### Q. 23. Can we know God in any other way than by our natural reason?

**A.** Besides knowing God by our natural reason, we can also know Him from supernatural revelation, that is, from the truths found in Sacred Scripture and in Tradition, which God Himself has revealed to us.

- Supernatural revelation is the communication of some truth by God to a creature through means that are beyond the ordinary course of nature. Some revealed truths, for example, the mystery of the Blessed Trinity, are strictly beyond the power of the human mind. We could never know such truths unless God revealed them. Other truths, for example, the immortality of the soul, while not beyond the power of the human mind, are objects of revelation because God has revealed them in a supernatural way. Although these latter truths could be known without revelation, they are grasped with greater ease and certainty once God has revealed them.
    
- God's public revelation of truths to men began with Adam and Eve and ended at the death of Saint the Apostle.
    
- Divine revelation contained in the Old Testament is called pre-Christian. It can be divided into: first, Primitive revelation, made to Adam and Eve; second, Patriarchal revelation, made to the patriarchs, for example, to Abraham and Lot; third, Mosaic revelation, made to Moses and the prophets. Christian revelation contains the truths revealed to us by Jesus Christ, either directly or through His apostles.
    
- The Church does not oblige the faithful to believe private revelations given, at certain times, to individuals. For our edification, however, the Church permits the publication of some private revelations. Those to whom private revelations are given are obliged to believe them when they are certain that the revelations are from God.
    
- Sacred Scripture, or the Bible, is the word of God written by men under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and contained in the books of the Old and the New Testament.
    
- Inspiration is the act by which God moves and directs the sacred writers faithfully to commit to writing all those things and only those things that He wishes them to write. The sacred writers act as free instruments of God, who is the principal author of Sacred Scripture.
    
- Tradition is the unwritten word of God - that body of truths revealed by God to the apostles, and not committed by them to writing but handed down by word of mouth. These truths, which were later committed to writing, particularly by the Fathers of the Church, have been preserved and handed down to the present day.
    

> `"But I have called you friends, because all things that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you" (John 15:15).`

> `"There are, however, many other things that Jesus did; but if every one of these should be written, not even the world itself, I think; could hold the books that would have to be written" (John 21:25).`

> `"So then, brethren, stand firm, and hold the teachings that you have learned, whether by word or by letter of ours" (2 Thessalonians 2:15).`

> `"All Scripture is inspired by God" (2 Timothy 3:16).`

> `"God, who at sundry times and in diverse manners spoke in times past to the fathers by the prophets, last of all in these days has spoken to us by his Son" (Hebrews 1:1).`

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT GOD AND HIS PERFECTIONS

- The most excellent knowledge that man can have is the knowledge of God. Our own natural reason tells us that there must be a Supreme Being who created the entire universe. He alone is existence; all other things are given existence by Him. With our natural reason we can know also that the Creator possesses all possible perfections or all good qualities. He is the cause of all perfection in creatures; hence, the perfections of all created things must be in Him in an infinitely superior manner to what they are in creatures.
    
- In order that men may know Him and His perfections more surely and more profoundly, God has given us divine revelations, which furnish us with clearer knowledge about His nature than reason could provide, and also manifest some truths about Him which natural reason could never learn by its own efforts. The first of God's revelations for the human race were given to Adam and Eve, and God continued to make such revelations until the death of the last apostle, St. John. Since that time there have been no new revelations for all mankind, although there have been private revelations for certain individuals. Moreover, there has been a growth of public revelation in the sense that, as time went on, men have gradually come to a deeper and clearer knowledge of the truths which God revealed of old. Thus, it was only after hundreds of years that
    
- Catholics clearly perceived that the doctrine of Mary's Immaculate Conception is contained in revelation. The revelations given by God for the human race are contained in Sacred Scripture, or the Bible which is the written word of God, and in divine Tradition, which is the unwritten word of God, since it was handed down, without being written, by those who received it from God, namely the apostles.
    
- The various perfections of God are mentioned in many passages of Scripture, as is evident from the many quotations from the Bible given in the preceding part of this lesson. Catholics should try to familiarize themselves with some of the principal texts which speak of God and of His infinite perfections. Moreover, the prayers employed or recommended by the Church abound with references to God and to His perfections. The liturgy of the Mass frequently speaks of the wonderful qualities of the Most High.
    
- Some of God's perfections have a special relation to ourselves. For example, when we think of God's goodness, we are inspired to love Him, not only because He is good to us but also because He is all-good in Himself. Thus, we make an act of divine charity, the most excellent of the virtues. Again, the truth that God is all-present and hence always near us, should help us to avoid sin. The realization that God is all-knowing should remind us that He is aware of even our most secret thoughts and desires. The thought of His providence, of His loving care over us to help us to attain everlasting happiness, should inspire us to have unbounded confidence in Him. In trials and temptations, we should remember that we are not alone; our loving Father is always near us.
    

### RESOLUTION:

- Resolve that during your entire life you will continue to study the truths of your Catholic religion, and thus by ever knowing God better and better, constantly prepare yourself for the happiness of heaven, which is the great goal of your life.

## Lesson 3: The Unity and Trinity of God `(Ba Ngôi Thiên Chúa và Sự Hiệp nhất)`

### Q. 24. Is there only one God?

**A.** Yes, there is only one God.

- Reason can prove that there is only one God. The assumption that there could be two infinitely perfect gods or two infinitely supreme beings independent of each other, is an absurdity. confirms our reasoning that there is only one God.

> `"That thou mightest know that the Lord he is God: and there is no other besides him" (Deuteronomy 4:35).`

> `"Thus, saith the Lord, the king of Israel and his redeemer the Lord of hosts: I am the First, and I am the Last: and besides me there is no God" (Isaias 44:6).`

> `"1 am the Lord, and there is none else: there is no God besides me" (Isaias 45:5).`

### Q. 25. How many Persons are there in God?

**A.** In God there are three divine Persons-the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

- Unaided by divine revelation, the human mind could not know the existence of the Blessed Trinity because it is a supernatural mystery. 3 Even after God has revealed the existence of the Blessed Trinity, we cannot understand it fully. When we believe, on the word of God, that there are three Persons in one God, we do not believe that three Persons are one Person, or that three gods are one God; this would be a contradiction. 3 (See question 34.)

> `"Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit" (Matthew 28:19).`

> `"And I will ask the Father and he will give you another Advocate to dwell with you forever, the Spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him" (John 14:16-17).`

> `"But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring to your mind whatever I have said to you" (John 14:26).`

### Q. 26. Is the Father God?

**A.** The Father is God and the first Person of the Blessed Trinity.

- The first Person of the Blessed Trinity is called the Father because from all eternity He begets the second Person, His only-begotten Son.
    
- God the Father is called the first Person not because He is greater or older than the other two Persons, but because He is unbegotten.
    

> `"This, then, is why the Jews were the more anxious to put him to death; because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal to God" (John 5:18).`

> `''Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort" (2 Corinthians 1:3).`

### Q. 27. Is the Son God?

**A.** The Son is God and the second Person of the Blessed Trinity.

- The second Person of the Blessed Trinity is called the Son because, from all eternity, He is the only begotten of the Father. Proceeding from the Father, the Son is called the Divine Word or the of the Father.

> `"All things have been delivered to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father; nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and him to whom the Son chooses to reveal him" (Matthew 11:27).`

> `"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God; and the Word was God" (John 1:1).`

> `"And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, that we may know the true God and may be in his true Son. He is the true God and eternal life" (1 John 5:20).`

> `"I and the Father are one" (John 10:30).`

### Q. 28. Is the Holy Ghost God?

**A.** The Holy Ghost is God and the third Person of the Blessed Trinity.

- The third Person of the Blessed Trinity is called the Holy Ghost because from all eternity He is breathed forth, as it were, by the Father and the Son. Proceeding from the Father and the Son, He is called the Gift or Love of the Father and the Son.
    
- The word "Ghost" applied to the third Person means "Spirit."
    

> `"But Peter`

> `"Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?" (1 Corinthians 3:16).`

### Q. 29. What do we mean by the Blessed Trinity?

**A.** By the Blessed Trinity we mean one and the same God in three divine Persons.

> *`See Scripture, question 25, Matthew 28:19; John 14:26.`*

### Q. 30. Are the three divine Persons really distinct from one another?

**A.** The three divine Persons are really distinct from one another.

- Although the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are distinct Persons, they are not distinct in nature. The nature of the Father is entirely the nature of the Son; and the nature of the Father and the Son is entirely the nature of the Holy Ghost.

### Q. 31. Are the three divine Persons perfectly equal to one another?

**A.** The three divine Persons are perfectly equal to one another, because all are one and the same God.

### Q. 32. How are the three divine Persons, though really distinct from one another, one and the same God?

**A.** The three divine Persons, though really distinct from one another, are one and the same God because all have one and the same divine nature.

- Because the three divine persons have one and the same perfections and the same external works are produced by them. But in order that we may better know the three divine Persons, certain perfections and works are attributed to each Person; for example, omnipotence and the works of omnipotence, such as creation, to the Father; wisdom and the works of wisdom, such as enlightenment, to the Son; love and the works of love, such as sanctification, to the Holy Ghost.

### Q. 33. Can we fully understand how the three divine Persons, though really distinct from one another, are one and the same God?

**A.** We cannot fully understand how the three divine Persons, though really distinct from one another, are one and the same God because this is a supernatural mystery.

### Q. 34. What is a supernatural mystery?

**A.** A supernatural mystery is a truth which we cannot fully understand, but which we firmly believe because we have God's word for it.

- In addition to those truths which can be attained by man's natural reason, there are certain mysteries hidden in God which we cannot know without divine revelation, but which we must believe because God has revealed them. Divine mysteries by their very nature are far above the power of human understanding and even when revealed and accepted on faith they remain obscure during our life on earth. To understand these things fully, a finite mind would have to comprehend the infinite. In heaven there will be a fuller understanding of these mysteries, but never an infinite comprehension of them.

**The Holy Trinity**

*This picture shows Jesus Christ seated in Heaven at the right hand of His Father on a throne of Glory. The angels and saints surround Him, and His throne is borne up by a multitude of celestial spirits. The Father holds a scepter and the Son His Cross, and both support the world, which was created by the Father, bought back by the Son, and sanctified by the Holy Spirit.*

- It is reasonable to believe supernatural mysteries revealed by God because He can neither deceive nor be deceived. In our everyday life we believe many things on the word of human beings even though at times they deceive or are deceived.

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT THE UNITY AND TRINITY OF GOD

- Both reason and revelation assure us that there is, and can be, only one God, for the very idea of the Supreme Being makes it impossible for God to have an equal; but from revelation we learn that the one God is three distinct Persons, known as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Before the coming of the Son of God this truth was not manifested even to the Jews, although there are some texts in the Old Testament which seem to imply that there is more than one Person possessing the divine nature - for example: "Let us make man to our image and likeness" (Genesis 1:26).
    
- In his discourse at the last supper Our Blessed Lord mentioned the three Persons by name, and He clearly spoke of the doctrine of the Holy Trinity to the apostles just before He ascended into heaven. The texts of Sacred Scripture containing these words of Christ have been given in this lesson. There was also an external manifestation of the Holy Trinity at the time of Our Lord's baptism by St. in the river Jordan. On that occasion it was God the Son in His human nature who was baptized, while God the Holy Ghost descended on Him in the form of a dove and God the Father announced from heaven: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." (Matthew 3:17).
    
- Hence, according to Catholic belief, there are three divine Persons but only one divine nature. All three Persons are perfectly equal to each other, because all possess the same divine nature with all its infinite perfections. From all eternity the Son proceeds from the Father as the Word, the product of the intellectual act whereby the Father understands the divine nature; and the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son as the product of the act of love of these two Persons for the divine goodness. All the actions of God outside of those whereby the second and third Persons proceed are acts of the three Persons operating together through the one divine nature. However, certain works performed by all three Persons are appropriated or attributed to particular Persons as if they individually performed them-for example, the work of creation to the Father, the work of producing the human nature of Christ to the Holy Ghost (Luke 1:35); but only the Second Person became incarnate.
    
- Although the doctrine of the Blessed Trinity is a supernatural mystery-a truth which we cannot discover by reason nor understand in the present life-we believe it because it has been made known to us by God who can neither deceive nor be deceived. Even in natural things there are many mysteries which we accept on the testimony of our fellowmen. We believe what the astronomers tell us about the stars and the planets, although we cannot prove these truths ourselves. Not even the most learned scientist understands fully the nature of the force we call electricity; yet we all know that there is such a force and we unhesitatingly accept the information that scientists give us about it. How much more willing should we be to believe the marvelous truth which God Himself has made known to us-that He is one in nature and three in Persons-even though we cannot perceive this truth by our own reason nor understand how each divine Person can be identical with the divine nature, yet really distinct from the other two Persons!
    
- On the first Sunday after Pentecost the Church celebrates a feast in honor of the Most Blessed Trinity. Moreover, on Sundays outside of the Christmas, Lenten and Easter seasons the Preface of the Holy Trinity is recited or chanted in the Mass. One of the favored devotions of the Catholic Church is the Doxology-the prayer: "Glory be to the Father and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen." This Doxology is frequently repeated in the official prayers of the Church, particularly in the Divine Office which priests and the members of many religious orders recite every day. And whenever we make the Sign of the Cross, we profess our faith in the mystery of the Most Blessed Trinity.
    

### RESOLUTION:

- Whenever you recite the Doxology or make the Sign of the Cross, try to remember that you are expressing your faith in the most profound mystery of the Catholic religion, the mystery of the Most Blessed Trinity.
- Complete Exercises For Lesson 3

#### A. TRUE OR FALSE.

*(Check each of the following statements as either true or false. The correct answers can be found in the preceding portions of the lesson)*

- Although we say that God the Father is the creator of heaven and earth, all three divine Persons created the universe equally.
- The second Person of the Blessed Trinity is called the Word.
- The Father existed before the Son and the Holy Ghost.
- It is unreasonable to believe anything we cannot understand.
- The third Person is called the Gift or Love of the Father and the Son.
- The third Person proceeds from the Father alone.
- The names Father, Son and Holy Ghost are names for one divine Person considered under three different aspects.
- The producing of the human nature of Christ is appropriated to the third Person, though all three Persons actually produced this nature.
- All three divine Persons became incarnate, in Jesus Christ.
- We shall understand the mystery of the Holy Trinity perfectly in heaven.

#### B. PROBLEMS AND EXERCISES.

*(Answer the questions orally or write them as your teacher may direct):*

- Does Lazarus, your Jewish neighbor, believe in the doctrine of the Most Holy Trinity? Did his Jewish ancestors, before the coming of Christ, have this doctrine expressly revealed to them?
- When did Our Lord clearly reveal the sublime truth of the Most Blessed Trinity?
- In what words did Our Lord make this revelation?
- What saying of Our Lord, at the Last Supper, revealed the names of the two other Persons of the Blessed Trinity?
- At the beginning of Our Lord's public ministry, the Baptist baptized Jesus in the waters of the river Jordan. Show how the three Persons of the Blessed Trinity externally manifested themselves then.
- Abner, a dealer in electrical supplies, and a Unitarian in religion, has great admiration for Jesus Christ, but he will not believe that Jesus is God. He refuses to believe that there are three Persons in God, He says that his mind revolts at the idea of believing something he cannot understand. Try to persuade him that he is wrong in maintaining such an attitude.
- What induces you to believe in the Most Blessed Trinity?
- In what ways does the Church pay honor to the Most Blessed Trinity?
- Name three instances in which you have accepted on faith from human beings something you could not perceive yourself.
- In church, Bonaventure picks up a leaflet of devotion to the nine choirs of angels. On it is printed the invitation to "recite the Doxology nine times each day." Bonaventure doesn't know what is meant by that strange word-Doxology. Tell him its meaning.
- Rosamond fails to answer a test question: "By what common devotional practice do we render homage to the Blessed Trinity?" What is your answer?
- Is the Holy Spirit the same as the Holy Ghost?
- Is it correct to say that whatever is above reason is also against reason? Is the doctrine of the Holy Trinity either against reason or above reason?
- It is related in the life of St. Patrick, the apostle of Ireland, that when he was preaching on the doctrine of the Holy Trinity to the pagan people of that land he plucked a shamrock and held it up to their gaze to illustrate the mystery of one God in three distinct divine Persons. A shamrock has three leaves on one stem. How would you illustrate the mystery by a three-leaf clover? Can you think of any other object to illustrate this wonderful mystery of the Holy Trinity?
- In Catholic art when the three Persons of the Holy Trinity are portrayed, the Father is represented as a venerable man with a long beard, the Son is represented by the picture of Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost is represented as a dove. Does this mean that God the Father, as well as the Son, took human nature? Does the fact that the Father is represented as a very old man indicate that the Father existed before the Son and the Holy Ghost?
- In the pictures just mentioned why is the Holy Ghost portrayed as a dove? Describe the incident on which this method of portraying the third Person is based. Did the third Person on that occasion take to Himself the nature of a dove in the same way that the second Person took to Himself human nature at the Incarnation?
- In the present lesson you have learned that the second Person of the Holy Trinity is called the Word. Do you know which of the four Evangelists uses this term for the Son of God in his Gospel? Do you know at what part of the Mass we use this term in the expression "The Word was made flesh?"
- When Our Lord worked miracles, such as the healing of the sick, in the course of His mortal life, He used His divine power. Now, was this divine power exercised by the second Person only, or was it exercised by the three Divine Persons?

## Lesson 4: Creation and the Angels `(Sự Sáng tạo và các Thiên Thần)`

### Q. 35. What do we mean when we say that God is the Creator of heaven and earth?

**A.** When we say that God is the Creator of heaven and earth, we mean that He made all things from nothing by His almighty power.

- Only God can create, that is, make something from nothing, because creation requires infinite power, which God alone possesses. All things except God depend on a cause for their existence and hence must have been created by God.3 God did not have to create the world; He did so freely.
    
- God preserves all creatures; otherwise, they would at once return to nothingness. He also governs all things, and in the divine government of the world nothing does or can happen unless God wills or permits it. Evil is the lack of some perfection. God does not will physical evil in itself but only insofar as it is connected with some good.
    
- God wills or permits the physical evils of life in order to punish sin, to make sinners repent, to try the just and make them worthy of everlasting reward, or to be the occasion of some other greater good. God permits but does not will moral evils.
    

> `"Thus, saith the Lord, thy redeemer, and thy maker from the womb: I am the Lord, that make all things, that alone stretch out the heavens that establish the earth. And there is none with me" (Isaias 44:24).`

> `"For in him were created all things in the heavens and on the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether Thrones, or Dominations, or Principalities, or Powers. All things have been created through and unto him, and he is before all creatures, and in him all things hold together" (Colossians 1:16-17).`

### Q. 36. Which are the chief creatures of God?

**A.** The chief creatures of God are angels and men.

- It is a matter of faith that God the Creator produced out of nothing creatures both spiritual and corporal, angelic and earthly. 4

> *`See Daniel 3:57. See also Scripture, question 35, Colossians 1:16-17.`*

### Q. 37. What are angels?

**A.** Angels are created spirits, without bodies, having understanding and free will.

- Reason alone cannot prove that the angels exist. Reason indicates that, just as there are purely material creatures and creatures composed of both matter and spirit, so also it is fitting that there should be purely spiritual creatures.
    
- Angels are spiritual beings inferior to God and superior to man. Sacred Scripture frequently speaks of the angels and mentions three by name: the Archangels Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael.5
    
- The nine "choirs" of angels are the Seraphim, Cherubim, Thrones, Dominations, Virtues, Powers, Principalities, Archangels, and Angels. 6 The exact number of angels is unknown, but Sacred Scripture indicates that their number is very great.
    

> `"Thousands of thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times a hundred thousand stood before Him" (Daniel 7:10).`

> `"Or dost thou suppose that I cannot entreat my Father, and he will even now furnish me with more than twelve legions of angels?" (Matthew 26:53).`

> `"Are they not all ministering spirits, sent for service, for the sake of those who shall inherit salvation?" (Hebrews 1:14).`

> `"Rash and self-willed, such men in their deriding do not regard majesty; whereas angels, though greater in strength and power, do not bring against themselves an abusive charge" (2 Peter 2:11).`

### Q. 38. What gifts did God bestow on the angels when He created them?

**A.** When God created the angels He bestowed on them great wisdom, power, and holiness.

- God bestowed upon the angels supernatural grace by which they could gain eternal happiness. The angels were given the opportunity to merit the reward of heaven by remaining faithful to God.

### Q. 39. Did all the angels remain faithful to God?

**A.** Not all the angels remained faithful to God; some of them sinned.

- We do not know the exact nature of the test to which God put the angels that they might prove themselves worthy of eternal happiness. The angels who were unfaithful committed a serious sin, for which they were punished.

> `"For God did not spare the angels when they sinned but dragged them down by infernal ropes to Tartarus, and delivered them to be tortured and kept in custody for judgment" (2 Peter 2:4).`

> `"And the angels also who did not preserve their original state, but forsook their abode, he has kept in everlasting chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day" (6).`

### Q. 40. What happened to the angels who remained faithful to God?

**A.** The angels who remained faithful to God entered into the eternal happiness of heaven, and these are called good angels.

> `"See that you do not despise one of these little ones for I tell you, their angels in heaven always behold the face of my Father in heaven" (Matthew 18:10).`

### Q. 41. What do the good angels do in heaven?

**A.** In heaven the good angels see, love, and adore God.

> *`See Scripture, question 40.`*

### Q. 42. How do the good angels help us?

**A.** The good angels help us by praying for us, by acting as messengers from God to us, and by serving as our guardian angels.

- The Old and the New Testament refer frequently to the work of the good angels among men. A good angel was the guide of God's chosen people (Exodus 23:20); the protector of was a good angel ( ff). The Archangel Gabriel announced the glad tidings of the Incarnation to Our Blessed Mother (Luke 1:28).
    
- Although angels are pure spirits, they can be seen by man when on special occasions God permits them to take on bodies or the appearance of bodies, which are visible to the human eye.
    

> `"For to his angels he has given thee in trust, to keep thee in all thy ways. In their hands they shall bear thee up, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone" (Psalm 90:11-12).`

> `"Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, of the house of David, and the virgin's name was Mary. And when the angel had come to her, he said, 'Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women" (Luke 1:26-28).`

### Q. 43. How do our guardian angels help us?

**A.** Our guardian angels help us by praying for us, by protecting us from harm, and by inspiring us to do good.

- It is a matter of faith that angels are deputed as the guardians of men. It is commonly held that each individual has a special guardian angel.

> `"When thou didst pray with tears, and didst bury the dead, and didst leave thy dinner, and hide the dead by day in thy house, and bury them by night, I offered thy prayer to the Lord .... For I am the angel Raphael, one of the seven, who stand before the Lord" (Tobias 12:12, 15).`

### Q. 44. What happened to the angels who did not remain faithful to God?

**A.** The angels who did not remain faithful to God were cast into hell, and these are called bad angels, or devils.

- The devils, or the evil spirits, were created by God, not as bad beings but as good beings. By their own free acts, they chose evil and thereby became bad angels.

> `"Depart from me, accursed ones, into the everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels" (Matthew 25:41).`

### Q. 45. What is the chief way in which the bad angels try to harm us?

**A.** The chief way in which the bad angels try to harm us is by tempting us to sin.

- Devils are sometimes permitted to enter the body of a man and to exercise power over his faculties-a state known as diabolical possession; or they are permitted to torment a person from without-a state known as diabolical obsession.
    
- Diabolic possession and obsession are permitted by God to show forth His glory, to punish sin, to bring sinners to repentance, or to give occasion for the exercise of virtue. When the devil uses the body of a possessed person to say or do evil things, the person is not guilty of sin, provided he does not freely consent.
    
- Exorcism is the act of driving out or warding off evil spirits from persons, places, or things possessed or infested by them. The Church received from Christ the power of exorcism.
    
- An exorcist is one who has power, conferred by a bishop, to exorcise demons. The order of exorcist is the third of the four minor orders of the Western Church. Only with the permission of his bishop is a priest allowed to use his power of exorcising evil spirits.
    

> `"Then having summoned his twelve disciples, he gave them power over unclean spirits, to cast them out" (Matthew 10:1).`

> `"Put on the armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil" (Ephesians 6:11).`

> `"Be sober, be watchful! For your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goes about seeking someone to devour. Resist him, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same suffering befalls your brethren all over the world" (1 Peter 5:8-9).`

### Q. 46. Do all temptations come from the bad angels?

**A.** Some temptations come from the bad angels; but other temptations come from ourselves and from the persons and things about us.

- The bad angels, the persons and things about us, and we ourselves can excite the senses and be an inducement to sin.

> `"For I am delighted with the law of God according to the inner man, but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me prisoner to the law of sin that is in my members" (Romans 7:22-23).`

> `"Let no man say when he is tempted, that he is tempted by God; for God is no tempter to evil, and he himself tempts no one. But everyone is tempted by being drawn away and enticed by his own passion" (James 1:13-14).`

> `"Do not love the world, or the things that are in the world" (1 John 2:15).`

### Q. 47. Can we always resist temptations?

**A.** We can always resist temptations, because no temptation can force us into sin, and because God will always help us if we ask Him.

- God does not demand the impossible; however, He warns us that in our efforts to overcome temptation we must not rely entirely on ourselves but must seek His help. God permits us to be tempted in order to make us realize our weakness, to test our faith, and to help us by His grace to strengthen virtue by practice and to obtain the reward of eternal life. The most effective means of overcoming temptation are prayer, mortification, frequent Confession and Holy Communion, and avoiding idleness and the near occasion of sin.

> `"Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall. May no temptation take hold of you but such as man is equal to. God is faithful and will not permit you to be tempted beyond your strength, but with the temptation will also give you a way out that you may be able to bear it" ( 1 Corinthians 10:12-13).`

> `"And he has said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for thee' "(2 Corinthians 12:9).`

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT CREATION AND THE ANGELS

* One of the usual names for God is "Creator." Both reason and revelation assure us that everything outside of God has been created, or brought into existence from nothingness by His almighty power. Moreover, after He has created something, God continues to keep it in existence; this is called divine conservation.

* In the first chapter of the Bible, we read that in the beginning God created heaven and earth; and then the Sacred Scripture tells us that in the course of six days God made the various elements of the universe-the sun and moon and stars, the plants and the animals, and finally man.

* Before He created men, God created another class of intellectual beings, known as angels-spirits without bodies, endowed with great perfections, particularly with profound intelligence. God wished the angels to share His supernatural happiness in heaven, but He wished them first to merit this privilege by their own free actions. Hence, while He raised the angels to the supernatural order by giving them sanctifying grace, God did not admit them at once to the beatific vision but imposed on them a test of their fidelity. Many of the angels were faithful to God; as a reward they were admitted immediately to the everlasting joys of heaven. Their leader was St. Michael. Others, led by Lucifer, who is now called Satan or Beelzebub, in their willful pride rebelled against God. St. Thomas Aquinas, the great theologian, taught that the wicked angels committed sin either by rejecting the supernatural happiness to which God called them because they were satisfied with their own natural perfections, or by desiring to attain to supernatural happiness by their natural powers. Those sinful angels were cast into hell for all eternity and are now called devils.

* The good angels, who praise and enjoy God in heaven, are employed by Him in the service of mankind. Many passages of Scripture record that God's designs for the human race were carried out through the ministry of angels. This was especially the case in connection with the Incarnation. The angel Gabriel announced to our Lady that she was to be the Mother of the divine Redeemer; angels proclaimed His birth to the shepherds on the first Christmas night; an angel warned St. Joseph of Herod's murderous plan and bade him take the Child and His Mother into Egypt, and later informed him of Herod's death and commanded the Holy Family to return; angels ministered to Our Lord after His threefold temptation by the devil; an angel comforted Him during His agony in the garden; angels announced His Resurrection and His Ascension into heaven.

* In His goodness, God protects us by the ministry of angels. It is commonly believed that each individual has a special guardian angel, although it is not taught by the Church as an article of faith. Our angel guardian accompanies us from birth until death, praying for us in a special way, inspiring us with good thoughts, striving to protect us from dangers of body and of soul. On October 2nd the Church celebrates a feast in honor of the Guardian Angels. There are also three feasts in the course of the year to honor the three angels whose names we know from the Sacred Scripture-St. Michael (September 29th), St. Gabriel (March 24th), and St. Raphael (October 24th). There is also a feast on May 8th to honor an extraordinary apparition of St. Michael.

* God allows the devils to tempt human beings by working on their imagination. Sometimes the devil is permitted by God to attack a human being more directly by obsession (from without) or by possession (from within the body). Sometimes very holy persons were tormented in this way. The devil can never force a person to commit sin; God will always give us sufficient grace to resist temptation.

### RESOLUTION:

- Resolve to think of your guardian angel at least once a day, either in your morning or in your night prayers. Thank him for his protection, ask him to continue his loving care for you, so that one day you may be with him in heaven.

## Lesson 5: The Creation and the Fall of Man `(Sự Sáng tạo và Sự Sa ngã của Con người)`

### Q. 48. What is man?

**A.** Man is a creature composed of body and soul, and made to the image and likeness of God.

- The soul and the body are not loosely connected parts of man; they are united in a substantial union to form one complete human nature. The soul is not located in any particular member of the body but is whole and entire in each part.

> `"And the Lord God formed man of the slime of the earth, and breathed into his face the breath of life; and man became a living soul" (Genesis 2:7).`

> `"And God created man to his own image; to the image of God he created him. Male and female he created them" (Genesis 1:27).`

### Q. 49. Is this likeness to God in the body or in the soul?

**A.** This likeness to God is chiefly in the soul.

- All creatures bear some resemblance to God inasmuch as they exist. Plants and animals resemble Him insofar as they have life, but none of these creatures is made to the image and likeness of God. Plants and animals do not have a rational soul, such as man has, by which they might know and love God.

### Q. 50. How is the soul like God?

**A.** The soul is like God because it is a spirit having understanding and free will, and is destined to live forever.

- Men are especially like God when they know and love Him: first, in a merely natural way without the aid of grace; second, in a supernatural way here on earth, with the aid of grace; third, in a perfect way in heaven, with the aid of the special light God gives to the souls of the blessed.
    
- Understanding is the power of the soul to apprehend, to judge, and to reason, and thus to know right and wrong. Conscience is that judgment by which we decide here and now what we should do as good or avoid as evil. Free will is that power of the soul to choose either to act or not to act. Human souls live forever because they are spirits. 7 The never-ending life of the soul is called immortality.
    

> `"And the dust return into its earth, from whence it was, and the spirit return to God, who gave it" (Ecclesiastes 12:7).`

> `"Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul" (Matthew 10:28).`

> `"These will go into everlasting punishment, but the just into everlasting life" (Matthew 25:46).`

### Q. 51. Who were the first man and woman?

**A.** The first man and woman were Adam and Eve, the first parents of the whole human race.

- The theory of evolution which teaches that higher forms of life develop from lower forms has offered no convincing, scientific proof that the human body developed gradually from that of a lower animal.
    
- If scientific proof of such development of the body of man could be had, it would not be opposed to Catholic doctrine provided that some special action of God is admitted not only in the creation of the soul but also in the production of the body of Adam. The human soul, being spiritual, could not possibly have developed from a lower, material form of life. Sacred Scripture teaches that Adam's soul, like every human soul, was created directly by God.
    

> *`See Scripture, question 48, Genesis 2:7.`*

### Q. 52. What was the chief gift bestowed on Adam and Eve by God?

**A.** The chief gift bestowed on Adam and Eve by God was sanctifying grace, which made them children of God and gave them the right to heaven.

- Sanctifying grace is a supernatural gift which is a sharing in the nature of God Himself and which raises men to the supernatural order, conferring on them powers entirely above those proper to human nature. Together with sanctifying grace God gave Adam and Eve the supernatural virtues and the gifts of the Holy Ghost.

> `"For just as by the disobedience of the one man the many were constituted sinners, so also by the obedience of the one the many will be constituted just" (Romans 5:19).`

### Q. 53. What other gifts were bestowed on Adam and Eve by God?

**A.** The other gifts bestowed on Adam and Eve by God were happiness in the Garden of Paradise, great knowledge, control of the passions by reason, and freedom from suffering and death.

- These gifts are not supernatural or above all created natures, but they are preternatural, that is, beyond the powers of human nature, though not above all created natures. If Adam had not sinned, these gifts would have been transmitted to all men as the possession of human nature.

> `"He created of him a helpmate like to himself: he gave them counsel, and a tongue and eyes, and ears, and a heart to devise: and he filled them with the knowledge of understanding. He created in them the science of the spirit: he filled their heart with wisdom, and shewed them both good and evil" (Ecclesiasticus 17:5-6).`

> `"Therefore, as through one man sin entered into the world and through sin death, and thus death has passed unto all men because all have sinned-for until the Law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law" (Romans 5:12-13).`

### Q. 54. What commandment did God give Adam and Eve?

**A.** God gave Adam and Eve the commandment not to eat of the fruit of a certain tree that grew in the Garden of Paradise. 8

- God wished to test the obedience of our first parents in order that they might have the privilege of proving themselves faithful to Him and of meriting, in a special way, everlasting happiness in heaven.

> `"And he commanded him, saying: Of every tree of paradise thou shalt eat: But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat. For in what day so ever thou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the death" (Genesis 2:16-17).`

### Q. 55. Did Adam and Eve obey the commandment of God?

**A.** Adam and Eve did not obey the commandment of God, but ate of the forbidden fruit.

- In eating the forbidden fruit Adam and Eve committed sins of pride and disobedience. Our first parents sinned grievously because they deliberately disobeyed a grave command of God.

> `"And the woman saw that the tree was good to eat, and fair to the eyes, and delightful to behold: and she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave to her husband who did eat" (Genesis 3:6).`

### Q. 56. What happened to Adam and Eve on account of their sin?

**A.** On account of their sin Adam and Eve lost sanctifying grace, the right to heaven, and their special gifts; they became subject to death, to suffering, and to a strong inclination to evil, and they were driven from the Garden of Paradise.

- The loss of sanctifying grace and the special gifts marked the beginning of that conflict between man's lower powers and his reason, of which Saint Paul says, "The flesh lusts against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh ... " (Galatians 5:17). Sacred Scripture teaches us that Adam, by the grace of God, later obtained the remission of his sin.

> `"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return to the earth, out of which thou wast taken: for dust thou art, and into dust thou shalt return" (Genesis 3:19).`

> `"And the Lord God made for Adam and his wife garments of skins, and clothed them" (Genesis 3:21).`

> `"And the Lord God sent him out of the paradise of pleasure, to till the earth from which he was taken" (Genesis 3:23).`

> `"She preserved him, that was first formed by God, the father of the world, when he was created alone, and she brought him out of his sin and gave him power to govern all things" (Wisdom 10:1-2).`

### Q. 57. What has happened to us on account of the sin of Adam?

**A.** On account of the sin of Adam, we, his descendants, come into the world deprived of sanctifying grace and inherit his punishment, as we would have inherited his gifts had he been obedient to God.

> `"But, by the envy of the devil, death came into the world" (Wisdom 2:24).`

> `"For just as by the disobedience of the one man the many were constituted sinners, so also by the obedience of the one the many will be constituted just" (Romans 5:19).`

### Q. 58. What is this sin in us called?

**A.** This sin in us is called original sin.

### Q. 59. Why is this sin called original?

**A.** This sin is called original because it comes down to us through our origin, or descent, from Adam.

> *`See Scripture, question 53, Romans 5:12-13.`*

### Q. 60. What are the chief punishments of Adam which we inherit through original sin?

**A.** The chief punishments of Adam which we inherit through original sin are death, suffering, ignorance, and a strong inclination to sin.

- The fact of original sin explains why man is so often tempted to evil and why he so easily turns from God. Because of the ignorance resulting from original sin, the mind of man has difficulty in knowing many necessary truths, easily falls into error, and is more inclined to consider temporal than eternal things.
    
- The penalties of original sin-death, suffering, ignorance, and a strong inclination to sin--remain after Baptism, even though original sin is taken away. Although we have a strong inclination to evil as a result of original sin, our nature is not evil in itself; it can perform some good actions in the natural order without the aid of grace.
    

> `"For the imagination and thought of man's heart are prone to evil from his youth" (Genesis 8:21).`

### Q. 61. Is God unjust in punishing us on account of the sin of Adam?

**A.** God is not unjust in punishing us on account of the sin of Adam, because original sin does not take away from us anything to which we have a strict right as human beings, but only the free gifts which God in His goodness would have bestowed on us if Adam had not sinned.

- Original Sin; its bad effects; its good effects (Our Lord became Man because it - notice the upper left and right inserts)
    
- This picture shows the disobedience of Adam and Eve. God had forbidden them, under pain of death, to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Eve, deceived by the demon who hid himself under the form of a serpent, ate of the forbidden fruit and gave some to her husband who similarly ate of it.
    
- Adam and Eve, having lost the grace of God by their sin, became subject to ignorance, uncontrolled passions, pain, and death, and they were banished from the earthly paradise.
    
- At the bottom, the Angel of the Lord, armed with a flaming sword, is driving Adam and Eve from the earthly paradise. Subject to the miseries of life, they will fall under the blow of Death, who waits for them with a scythe in his hand.
    
- The Cross of Jesus Christ, which is seen at the top left, signifies that Our Lord delivered us from original sin by His death. God had promised this deliverance to our first parents by announcing to them that one day a son of the woman would crush the head of the infernal serpent.
    
- On the right, a priest is baptizing a little child, showing that baptism washes away the stain of original sin in us.
    

### Q. 62. Was any human person ever preserved from original sin?

**A.** The Blessed Virgin Mary was preserved from original sin in view of the merits of her Divine Son; and this privilege is called her Immaculate Conception.

- In the first instant of her conception the Blessed Virgin Mary possessed the fullness of sanctifying grace, the infused virtues, and the gifts of the Holy Ghost. She was, however, subject to pain and suffering, as was her Divine Son. By a special privilege of Almighty God, Our Blessed Mother was free throughout her life from all actual sin, both mortal and venial.

> `"I will put enmities between you and the woman, between your seed and her seed: he shall crush your head, and you shall lie in wait for his heel" (Genesis 3:15).`

> `"And when the angel had come to her, he said, 'Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women' " (Luke 1:28).`

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT THE CREATION AND THE FALL OF MAN

- There are many persons in the world who believe that human beings are merely animals of a higher type than the other animals on earth, and like them are destined to perish entirely with death. Against this materialistic view the Catholic Church holds the doctrine that every human being has a spiritual soul that is like to God Himself-a soul that will never die but will live for all eternity. Every human soul is directly created by God.
    
- The Bible describes in great detail the beginning of the human race. God created a man, named Adam, forming his body from the dust of earth and creating his soul. Shortly afterward God made Eve from a rib of Adam, whose wife she was to be. Then the Almighty blessed the pair as husband and wife, bidding them: "Increase and multiply" (Genesis 1:28). God bestowed on Adam and Eve wonderful privileges. They dwelt in a beautiful garden; they were free from inordinate inclinations to sin; they were preserved from suffering; they were destined never to die, but after a space of time on earth, to be taken, body and soul, into heaven. Above all, they were endowed with the precious gift of sanctifying grace that made them the beloved children of God.
    
- It was God's plan that these privileges should be transferred from Adam to all his descendants. However, He made this dependent on the faithfulness of Adam in obeying His command not to eat the fruit of a particular tree. Adam disobeyed; and hence lost these precious gifts for himself and for all his descendants. Eve also sinned and lost the privileges for herself. There was no injustice on God's part in depriving Adam's descendants of these privileges because of his sin. The favors He gave our first parents were purely gratuitous; our first parents had no right to them. Hence, there was no injustice on the part of God in withholding them from Adam's descendants. It was as if a wealthy man told a poor man he could live in a splendid house on his property and pass it on to his descendants, if he would obey a certain command; if the poor man disobeyed, and accordingly lost the fine residence for himself and for his children, the rich man would be doing them no wrong by depriving them of the house.
    
- The entire human race is descended from Adam and Eve; hence, we all enter the world deprived of the gifts we should have had if Adam had not sinned. The deprivation of sanctifying grace, called original sin, brings with it the necessity of submitting to suffering and to death. This is the significance of the words spoken by God to Adam after his sin, and repeated to each of the faithful on Ash Wednesday when the priest places ashes on his brow: "Remember, man, that thou art dust, and into dust thou shalt return" (Genesis 3:19). Yet, through the goodness of God we can recover sanctifying grace, and even though we are not restored entirely to the original state of our first parents, who were free from suffering and death and inordinate inclinations to sin, we can make these penalties of Adam's transgression the occasions of practicing virtue.
    
- Nowadays many persons, claiming that man is descended from an animal, such as an ape, reject the account of creation given in the Bible. We admit that God could have brought the human race into existence in this way as regards the body of man; and if the evolutionary theory to this extent were ever proved, we should have no difficulty in admitting it. The soul of man, however, can come into being only by the direct act of the Creator.
    
- Our Blessed Lord, since He is God, could have no original sin. Furthermore, original sin is transmitted to an infant by its father when he shares in giving it life, and Our Lord had no earthly father. Moreover, it is a doctrine of the Catholic faith that His Blessed Mother, Mary, on account of her great dignity as Mother of God, was preserved from original sin in the very first moment of her existence. This great privilege is known as her Immaculate Conception.
    
- Catholics should have a clear idea of the meaning of the Immaculate Conception, since many persons confuse it with the virginal conception of Jesus Christ, which was an entirely different privilege of our Lady. God spoke of the Immaculate Conception immediately after the sin of our first parents, when He promised a Redeemer, and added that the Mother of the Redeemer would be at perpetual enmity with the devil, the author of sin: "I will put enmities between thee (the devil) and the woman, and thy seed and her seed: she shall crush thy head" (Genesis 3:15). This doctrine of Mary's Immaculate Conception is contained also in the Tradition of the Church, which has always attributed to Mary the fullest possible measure of holiness and freedom from sin. The feast of the Immaculate Conception is a holyday of obligation, celebrated on December 8th. Moreover, Mary Immaculate is the Patroness of the United States of America.
    

### RESOLUTION:

- Resolve to call on our Blessed Mother in time of temptation with the prayer that honors her Immaculate Conception: "Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us who have recourse to thee"; (Indulgence: 300 days; Plenary indulgence under usual conditions. S.P. Ap., April 15, 1932).

## Lesson 6: Actual Sin `(Tội Lỗi Hiện Tại)`

### Q. 63. Is original sin the only kind of sin?

**A.** Original sin is not the only kind of sin; there is another kind, called actual sin, which we ourselves commit.

### Q. 64. What is actual sin?

**A.** Actual sin is any willful thought, desire, word, action, or omission forbidden by the law of God.

### Q. 65. How many kinds of actual sin are there?

**A.** There are two kinds of actual sin: mortal sin and venial sin.

### Q. 66. What is mortal sin?

**A.** Mortal sin is a grievous offense against the law of God.

### Q. 67. Why is this sin called mortal?

**A.** This sin is called mortal, or deadly, because it deprives the sinner of sanctifying grace, the supernatural life of the soul.

> `"Flee from sins as from the face of a serpent: for if thou comest near them, they will take hold of thee. The teeth thereof are the teeth of a lion, killing the souls of men" (Ecclesiasticus 21:2-3).`

### Q. 68. Besides depriving the sinner of sanctifying grace, what else does mortal sin do to the soul?

**A.** Besides depriving the sinner of sanctifying grace, mortal sin makes the soul an enemy of God, takes away the merit of all its good actions, deprives it of the right to everlasting happiness in heaven, and makes it deserving of everlasting punishment in hell.

> `"But, if the just man turn himself away from his justice and do iniquity according to all the abominations which the wicked man useth to work, shall he live? All his justices which he hath done shall not be remembered: in the prevarication by which he hath prevaricated and in his sin which he hath committed, in them he shall die" (Ezechiel 18:24).`

> `"Then when passion has conceived, it brings forth sin; but when sin has matured, it begets death" (James 1:15).`

### Q. 69. What three things are necessary to make a sin mortal?

**A.** To make a sin mortal these three things are necessary: first, the thought, desire, word, action, or omission must be seriously wrong or considered seriously wrong; second, the sinner must be mindful of the serious wrong; third, the sinner must fully consent to it.

- Things seriously evil are known to be such from Sacred Scripture, Tradition, the teachings of the Church, or from the nature of the acts themselves. The sinner is mindful of the serious wrong if at the time he commits the sin or places a cause from which he foresees the sin will follow, he either is clearly aware or at least thinks that the action is grievously sinful.
    
- A sinner fully consents to the wrong when he freely chooses to do evil, although he is entirely free not to do it. A person who deliberately consents to do something grievously sinful is guilty of mortal sin although he never actually does it, because his will has chosen evil in preference to good. When a sinner, mindful of evil, consents to it he is said to commit a formal sin.
    
- When a person does wrong but is in no way mindful of it, he is said to commit a material sin; for example, a person who misses Mass, unmindful that it is Sunday, commits a material sin. God does not hold us accountable for material sins and they do not deprive us of sanctifying grace.
    

> `"Before man is life and death, good and evil: that which he shall choose shall be given him" (Ecclesiasticus 15:18).`

### Q. 70. What is venial sin?

**A.** Venial sin is a less serious offense against the law of God, which does not deprive the soul of sanctifying grace, and which can be pardoned even without sacramental Confession.

- Venial sin, under certain conditions, can become mortal: first, when an action which is not seriously wrong is performed by a person who thinks it is seriously wrong; second, by reason of circumstances affecting the act; for example, if a person under oath to tell the truth were to lie about a light matter; third, when the matter of several sins, in themselves not serious, adds up to a serious amount; for example, if someone were to steal small sums of money which would accumulate to a serious amount.

### Q. 71. How can a sin be venial?

**A.** A sin can be venial in two ways: first, when the evil done is not seriously wrong; second, when the evil done is seriously wrong, but the sinner sincerely believes it is only slightly wrong, or does not give full consent to it.

- If a person being uncertain of the gravity of a sin nevertheless commits the sin, he is guilty of mortal sin because he shows himself willing to offend God seriously. One should not act in doubt but should form a certain conscience.

### Q. 72. How does venial sin harm us?

**A.** Venial sin harms us by making us less fervent in the service of God, by weakening our power to resist mortal sin, and by making us deserving of God's punishments in this life or in purgatory.

> `"A workman that is a drunkard shall not be rich: and he that condemneth small things shall fail by little and little" (Ecclesiasticus 19:1).`

> `"But I tell you, that of every idle word men speak, they shall give account on the Day of Judgment" (Matthew 12:36).`

### Q. 73. How can we keep from committing sin?

**A.** We can keep from committing sin by praying and by receiving the sacraments; by remembering that God is always with us; by recalling that our bodies are temples of the Holy Ghost; by keeping occupied with work or play; by promptly resisting the sources of sin within us; by avoiding the near occasions of sin.

### Q. 74. What are the chief sources of actual sin?

**A.** The chief sources of actual sin are: pride, covetousness, lust, anger, gluttony, envy, and sloth, and these are commonly called capital sins.

- Pride is the inordinate seeking of one's own excellence. It is opposed to the virtue of humility.
- Covetousness is the inordinate seeking of temporal goods. Covetousness is two-fold: first, the inordinate seeking of temporal goods by acquiring or possessing them unjustly. This form of covetousness is opposed to the virtue of justice and is often a mortal sin; second, the inordinate seeking of temporal goods by loving or desiring them too much. This form of covetousness is opposed to liberality and is ordinarily a venial sin.
- Lust is the inordinate seeking of the pleasures of the flesh. It is opposite to the virtue of chastity.
- Anger is the inordinate seeking of revenge, or an unreasonable opposition to a person or thing. It is opposed to the virtue of meekness.
- Gluttony is the inordinate desire for food and drink. It is opposed to the virtue of temperance.
- Envy is sadness at another's good fortune because it is considered to be detracting from one's own excellence. It is opposed to the virtue of charity.
- Sloth is the distaste for spiritual things because their attainment requires much labor. It is opposed to the virtue of charity.

### Q. 75. Why are these called capital sins?

**A.** They are called capital sins not because they, in themselves, are the greatest sins, but because they are the chief reasons why men commit sin.

- Pride is the source of presumption, ambition, vainglory, and boasting,
- Covetousness is the source of hard-heartedness toward the poor, and of theft, fraud, and deceit.
- Lust is the source of blindness of mind, thoughtlessness, over-hastiness, instability, love of oneself, hatred of God, worldliness, and despair.
- Anger is the source of contumely, blasphemy, quarrels, and murders.
- Gluttony is the source of dullness of mind, excessive talkativeness, and gross and vulgar speech.
- Envy is the source of hatred, calumny, detraction, joy in our neighbor's misfortunes, and distress at his prosperity.
- Sloth is the source of the neglect to perform good works that are of grave obligation.

### Q. 76. What are the near occasions of sin?

**A.** The near occasions of sin are all persons, places, or things that may easily lead us into sin.

- There is a grave obligation to avoid the near occasion of mortal sin. If circumstances force us into the near occasion of sin, we are obliged to make use of the necessary safeguards, such as prayer and the frequent reception of the sacraments of Penance and Holy Eucharist.

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT ACTUAL SIN

- By means of his free will, man can give God loyal and affectionate service; but by means of the same free will he can also offend God by committing actual sin. This sin can be committed in many ways. It can be entirely within man's mind and heart, as when he deliberately takes pleasure in something evil pictured in his imagination (sin of thought) or when he deliberately wishes something evil, even though he knows he can never do it (sin of desire). Or, a person can make use of his bodily faculties to offend God-by using his power of speech in bad language, such as blasphemy or cursing (sin of word), or by employing another bodily power, such as his hands to murder or to steal (sin of action) . Finally, a person can commit sin by neglecting to do something which he is obliged to do, as when he fails to go to Mass on Sunday or to help others in their need when he could and should do so (sin of omission).
    
- When a person is in doubt as to whether or not a certain action is sinful, he is not allowed to do it until he has made reasonable efforts to solve his doubt. Usually, the most practical way to solve such a doubt of conscience is to ask a priest, particularly in confession.
    
- The most important division of actual sins, mortal and venial, is explained at length in the lesson. Some persons have the idea that it is sufficient to avoid mortal sins; they freely commit venial sins. This is a false notion. Venial sin is a great evil--next to mortal sin, it is the greatest evil in the world, worse than the most painful sickness or the most dreadful form of death. One who pays no heed to venial sins will soon fall into mortal sin. It is true, on account of the weakness of human nature brought on by original sin no one (unless he receives a special privilege from God, such as was given to the Blessed Virgin Mary), can abstain for a long time from semi-deliberate venial sins, committed without full consent of the will. But all should strive to avoid every deliberate sin, whether it be venial or mortal. No one can ever claim that God does not give him sufficient grace to avoid such sins, for St. Paul tells us: "God is faithful and will not permit you to be tempted beyond your strength" (1 Cor. 10:13).
    
- However, venial sins, even though frequently committed, do not unite to form a mortal sin, though sometimes the matter involved in several sins, each of which in itself is venial, will accumulate to form a large amount, and thus eventually a mortal sin will be committed. Thus, if a clerk would steal fifty cents a day from the store in which he is employed, the total amount would soon become sufficient to render him guilty of mortal sin, even though the amount of each theft taken in itself would constitute only a venial sin.
    
- We must all be on our guard against the capital sins, which are the sources of all the other sins. It is not sufficient to resolve not to give in to the capital sins-we must strive to practice the opposite virtues. Everyone should honestly examine his own character and find out his predominant passion--that is, the type of sin to which he is most inclined-and try earnestly to overcome it. With God's grace, he shall eventually succeed.
    
- We must particularly avoid the near occasions of sin. Nowadays there are many occasions of sin in the world, such as bad books, heretical or improper radio programs, indecent motion pictures, vile theatrical exhibitions, and persons who try to lead others into sin by their bad speech or wicked conduct. Those who frequent unnecessarily the occasions of sin are running a great risk. "He that loveth danger shall perish in it" (Ecclus. 3:27).
    
- Above all, we have prayer and the sacraments to strengthen us against temptation to sin. Whenever an inclination to offend God besets our soul, our first thought should be to have recourse to prayer. It need not be a long prayer; even the devout calling on the names of Jesus and Mary will be of great help. And one who frequently receives Our Lord in Holy Communion obtains immeasurable spiritual strength against the weakness and evil inclinations of his nature that are the cause of so many sins.

## Lesson 7: The Incarnation `(Sự Nhập thể)`

> "I BELIEVE ... IN JESUS CHRIST, HIS ONLY SON, OUR LORD; WHO WAS CONCEIVED BY THE HOLY GHOST, BORN OF THE VIRGIN MARY ..."

### Q. 77. Did God abandon man after Adam fell into sin?

**A.** God did not abandon man after Adam fell into sin, but promised to send into the world a Saviour to free man from his sins and to reopen to him the gates of heaven.

- God could have abandoned man and allowed the human race to suffer the just penalty of never seeing Him face to face in heaven. In His infinite love and mercy, God took pity on Adam and his descendants and gave them the chance of salvation through the promised Redeemer.

> `"But while he thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, 'Do not be afraid, Joseph, son of David, to take to thee Mary thy wife, for that which is begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit. And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus; for he shall save his people from their sins' " (Matthew 1:2021).`

> `"For God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son, that those who believe in him may not perish, but may have life everlasting" (John 3:16).`

> `"And we have seen; and do testify, that the Father has sent his Son to be Saviour of the world" (1 John 4:14).`

### Q. 78. Who is the Saviour of all men?

**A.** The Saviour of all men is Jesus Christ.

- Not all men are saved, but all who attain salvation do so through the merits of Christ. That Jesus Christ is the promised Saviour can be proved from the prophecies of the Old Testament which are fulfilled in Him; from His own testimony, which is worthy of belief; and from the miracles He worked in proof of His divine mission, especially His Resurrection.
    
- The name "Jesus" means Saviour. "Christ," a Greek word meaning "anointed," signifies Jesus'- threefold office of King, Priest, and Prophet, because, of old, kings, priests, and prophets were anointed.
    

> `"For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, himself man, Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all, bearing witness in his own time" (1 Timothy 2:5-6).`

### Q. 79. What is the chief teaching of the Catholic Church about Jesus Christ?

**A.** The chief teaching of the Catholic Church about Jesus Christ is that He is God made man.

> `"And the angel said to her, 'Do not be afraid, Mary, for thou hast found grace with God. Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb and shalt bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father, and he shall be king over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.' But Mary said to the angel, 'How shall this happen, since I do not know man?' And the angel answered and said to her, 'The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee; and therefore the Holy One to be born shall be called the Son of God' " (Luke 1:30-35).`

> `"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God; and the Word was God...And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us. And we saw his glory - glory as of the only-begotten of the Father full of grace and of truth" (John1:1, 14).`

### Q. 80. Why is Jesus Christ God?

**A.** Jesus Christ is God because He is the only Son of God, having the same divine nature as His Father.

- Jesus Christ is the second Person of the Blessed Trinity, who from eternity proceeds by true spiritual generation from the Father. We believe Jesus Christ is God because God Himself revealed this truth: first, through the Prophets of the Old Testament who foretold that the promised Redeemer would be God; second, through Christ Himself, who claimed to be God and confirmed His own testimony by the holiness of His life, by the fulfillment of His prophecies, and by the miracles He worked in His own name and by His own power, especially His Resurrection.
    
- A miracle is something that is not according to the usual course of created nature, surpasses the power of all creatures, and consequently can be produced only by the power of God. The senses must be able to observe a miracle if it is to have the value of a proof for us.
    
- Only God can be the principal cause of a miracle because a miracle surpasses the power of all creatures. God sometimes uses creatures as instruments in performing miracles. Since God, who is all-truthful, is the principal cause of a miracle, it cannot be worked in support of a lie. The following are some of Christ's miracles: He restored sight to the blind, cured lepers in an instant, walked on the waters of the sea, multiplied the loaves and fishes, raised the dead to life, and finally, rose from the dead Himself by His own divine power.
    

**The Divinity of Christ.**

**Old Testament Prophecy**

> `"The Lord has said to me: 'Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee. Ask of me and I will give thee the gentiles for thine inheritance, and the ends of the earth as thy possession' " (Psalm 2:7-8).`

**Christ Claimed to be God**

> `"And the high priest said to him, 'I adjure thee by the living God that thou tell us whether thou art the Christ, the Son of God.' Jesus said to him, 'Thou hast said it. Nevertheless, I say to you, hereafter you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power and coming upon the clouds of heaven' " (Matthew 26:63-64).`

> `"I and the Father are one" (John 10:30).`

**Christ Confirmed His Testimony by Miracles**

> `"But he answered and said to them, 'An evil and adulterous generation demands a sign, and no sign shall be given it but the sign of the prophet. For even as was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth' " (Matthew 12:39-40).`

> `"They let down the pallet on which the paralytic was lying. And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, 'Son, thy sins are forgiven thee.' Now some of the Scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts, 'Why does this man speak thus? He blasphemes. Who can forgive sins, but only God?' And at once Jesus, knowing in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to them, 'Why are you arguing these things in your hearts? Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, "Thy sins are forgiven thee," or to say, "Arise, and take up thy pallet, and walk?" But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins' - he said to the paralytic - 'I say to thee, arise, take up thy pallet, and go to thy house.' And immediately he arose and, taking up his pallet, went forth in the sight of all, so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, 'Never did we see the like' " (Mark 2:4-12).`

> `"Thomas answered and said to him, 'My Lord and my God!' Jesus said to him, 'Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed. Blessed are they who have not seen, and yet have believed' " (John 20:28-29).`

### Q. 81. Why is Jesus Christ man?

**A.** Jesus Christ is man because He is the Son of the Blessed Virgin Mary and has a body and soul like ours.

- Although Christ's conception and birth were miraculous, He, like other men, came into the world as an infant, having Mary for His Mother. Since His origin from the Blessed Virgin is true generation, Mary is the Mother of Jesus Christ, who is God, and she is therefore truly the Mother of God.
    
- Christ, like other men, ate, drank, became tired, slept, and walked through Judea, Galilee, and Samaria. Christ, as man, was the most perfect of all men. He was endowed with human intelligence and free will; but He was free from all ignorance and error, from all sin and imperfection.
    
- The human soul of Christ could suffer as well as His body. For example, Christ was sorrowful unto death. In the garden of Gethsemani He said to His disciples: "My soul is sad, even unto death. Wait here and watch with me" (Matthew 26:38).
    

### Q. 82. Is Jesus Christ more than one Person?

**A.** No, Jesus Christ is only one Person; and that Person is the second Person of the Blessed Trinity.

- It is heresy to say that there are two Persons in Christ.

> `"For a child is born to us, and a son is given to us, and the government is upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called, Wonderful, Counsellor, God the Mighty, the Father of the world to come, the Prince of Peace" (Isaias 9:6).`

> `"For God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son, that those who believe in him may not perish, but may have life everlasting" (John 3:16).`

### Q. 83. How many natures has Jesus Christ?

**A.** Jesus Christ has two natures: the nature of God and the nature of man.

- There is a difference between person and nature. Human nature is composed of body and soul; in a human person is found the added perfection which makes each one an individual, distinct from all others. A human person has only one human nature. Christ is a divine Person having the nature of God and the nature of man.
    
- Christ proved He had both the nature of God and the nature of man by doing some things that only God could do, and other things that men do. It is heresy to deny the divine nature of Jesus Christ by accepting Him as merely a perfect man; it is also heresy to deny His human nature.
    
- The following is the defined teaching of the Church: "I also believe in the Son of God, the Word, begotten of the Father in eternity, before all time ... born in time of the Holy Ghost from Mary, ever virgin; born with a rational soul; having two nativities, one eternal of the Father, the other in time, of His Mother."
    

> `"For I could wish to be anathema myself from Christ for the sake of my brethren, who are my kinsmen according to the flesh; who are Israelites, who have the adoption as sons, and the glory and the covenants and the legislation and the worship and the promises; who have the fathers, and from whom is the Christ according to the flesh, who is, over all things, God blessed forever, amen" (Romans 9:3-5).`

> `"Have this mind in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who though he was by nature God, did not consider being equal to God a thing to be clung to, but emptied himself, taking the nature of a slave and being made like unto men. And appearing in the form of man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient to death, even to death on a cross" (Philippians 2:5-8).`

### Q. 84. Was the Son of God always man?

**A.** The Son of God was not always man, but became man at the time of the Incarnation.

> `"But when the fullness of time came, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the Law, that he might redeem those who were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of sons" (Galatians 4:4-5).`

### Q. 85. What is meant by the Incarnation?

**A.** By the Incarnation is meant that the Son of God, retaining His divine nature, took to Himself a human nature, that is, a body and soul like ours.

- The union of the second Person of the Blessed Trinity with human nature is called the hypostatic union.

### Q. 86. How was the Son of God made man?

**A.** The Son of God was conceived and made man by the power of the Holy Ghost in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary.

- The conception of the son of God in the womb is attributed to the power of the third Person of the Blessed Trinity because the Holy Ghost proceeds from the love of the Father and the Son, and the Incarnation is a work of God's great love for mankind. All three Persons of the Holy Trinity performed the act of divine power whereby the Incarnation took place. But Catholic faith teaches that only the second Person took to Himself a human nature.

> `"And the angel answered and said to her, 'The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee; and therefore, the Holy One to be born shall be called the Son of God' " (Luke 1:35).`

### Q. 87. When was the Son of God conceived and made man?

**A.** The Son of God was conceived and made man on Annunciation Day, the day on which the Angel Gabriel announced to the Blessed Virgin Mary that she was to be the Mother of God.

- We commemorate this event when we say the Angelus. The miraculous privileges accorded the Blessed Virgin Mary by Almighty God testify to her position as the most exalted of God's creatures.
    
- Mary, the Mother of God, remained a virgin not only in the conception of Christ but also in His birth and during the rest of her life. Because of her consent to accept the office of Mother of the Redeemer, and also because of her merits in intimately sharing the sufferings of her Divine Son for the salvation of mankind, the Blessed Virgin is given the title of Co-Redemptrix of the human race.
    
- After her death, the body of the Blessed Virgin, reunited with her soul, was miraculously taken up into heaven. The Church observes this event in the Feast of the Assumption. Special veneration, called hyperdulia, is given to the Blessed Virgin, because of her excellence which far surpasses that of all the saints and angels.
    

### Q. 88. Is Saint Joseph the father of Jesus Christ?

**A.** Jesus Christ had no human father, but Saint Joseph was the spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the guardian, or foster father, of Christ.

- God the Father is the only true Father of Jesus Christ. Christ was the only child of Mary. The brothers and sisters of Christ mentioned in the Bible were cousins.
    
- Saint Joseph's high dignity, grace, holiness, and glory have their source in the fact that he was the husband of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the foster father of the Son of God. Saint Joseph is the patron of the Universal Church.
    

> `"But while he thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, 'Do not be afraid, Joseph, son of David, to take to thee Mary thy wife, for that which is begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit. And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus; for he shall save his people from their sins' " (Matthew 1:2021).`

> `"And Jesus himself, when he began his work, was about thirty years of age, being-as was supposed-the son of Joseph" (Luke 3:23).`

*The Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary*

*This picture shows the angel Gabriel greeting the Most Holy Virgin in prayer in her house at Nazareth. He announces to Her that God has chosen Her to be the Mother of the Savior. At the same instant, the Holy Spirit, through a great miracle, works in Her the mystery of the Incarnation.*

**According to St. Luke, we read:**

> "Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, of the house of David, and the virgin's name was Mary. And when the angel had come to her, he said, 'Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.
> 
> Blessed art thou among women.' When she had heard him, she was troubled at his word, and kept pondering what manner of greeting this might be.
> 
> "And the angel said to her, 'Do not be afraid, Mary, for thou hast found grace with God. Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb and shalt bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his Name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father, and he shall be king over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end.'
> 
> "But Mary said to the angel, 'How shall this happen, since I do not know man?'
> 
> "And the angel answered and said to her, 'The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee; and therefore, the Holy One to be born shall be called the Son of God. And behold, Elizabeth thy kinswoman also has conceived a son in her old age, and she who was called barren is now in her sixth month; for nothing shall be impossible with God.'
> 
> "But Mary said, 'behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it done to me according to thy word.' And the angel departed from her." (St. Luke)

**The Nativity of Our Lord**

- In the center, the Child Jesus is born in the stable of Bethlehem. He is surrounded with the loving care of the Blessed Virgin Mary, His Mother, and of St. Joseph, His foster-father. Near the manger where He lies, there are the ox and ass which, according to tradition, were present.

> `The shepherds come to adore Him and, from Heaven, the angels sing the joyful song, "Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth to men of good will." (St. Luke 2:14)`

### Q. 89. When was Christ born?

**A.** Christ was born of the Blessed Virgin Mary on Christmas Day, in Bethlehem, more than nineteen hundred years ago.

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT THE INCARNATION

- After the disobedience of Adam, God could in all justice have refused to restore the human race to His friendship or to give men another opportunity of gaining heaven. But in His goodness the Almighty determined to save men from their sins and to open to them again the gates of heaven. However, God willed that full satisfaction for sin should be made to Him, and since sin is an offense against the infinite dignity of God, only a person of infinite dignity - that is, a divine Person-could make full satisfaction for sin. But a divine Person in His divine nature cannot suffer and consequently cannot make satisfaction; hence, if God was to receive full satisfaction for sin, it was necessary that a divine Person should take our human nature and in that nature suffer in satisfaction for the sins of mankind. That is the reason why the Son of God became man in the Incarnation.
    
- God promised this favor to Adam and Eve shortly after their fall, speaking of one that was to come into the world to crush the devil. The devil had led our first parents into sin, and God said to him: "I will put enmities between thee and the woman, and thy seed and her seed" (Gen. 3, 15). The woman is the Blessed Virgin Mary; the seed of the woman is our Saviour, Jesus Christ.
    
- Many centuries passed. Sometimes it is said that four thousand years elapsed between the sin of our first parents and the coming of the Saviour. But this is a matter of much uncertainty; the Catholic Church has never made any statement on this matter, and so we can hold that many centuries or even hundreds of centuries passed from the beginning of the human race until the birth of Our Saviour. The world became very wicked; men forgot God and gave themselves freely to all manner of sins. Among the Jewish people, the chosen people of God, the hope of the Saviour-to-come was kept alive by prophets, men inspired by God to convey His message to their fellow men. These prophets foretold so accurately the circumstances of the birth, the life, the death and the resurrection of the future Saviour that no one could reasonably fail to recognize Him when He came.
    
- The coming of the Redeemer was delayed so long in order that the world might learn from the many evils it suffered the great malice of sin and might know that God alone could raise up fallen man. Those who lived before the coming of the Redeemer could be saved if they had faith in God and kept His law. Thus, they received sanctifying grace through the anticipated merits of the Saviour.
    
- And when the time for the coming of the Saviour arrived, God announced it through an angel to a humble virgin of Nazareth named Mary, the daughter of Joachim and Ann. The angel told Mary that she was to be the mother of the world's Saviour, yet by a wonderful miracle she was to remain a virgin. We celebrate this great event on March 25, the Feast of the Annunciation. And nine months later in the stable of Bethlehem, where she and her spouse St. Joseph were obliged to pass the night because there was no room for them in the inn, the Blessed Virgin gave birth to the Child who was to save the world from Sin. The name given Him was Jesus; and He was the Christ, the one destined to be the world's Redeemer.
    
- When Christ began His preaching, He announced among other doctrines that He Himself was the true Son of God. By His wonderful miracles- which could be wrought only by divine power-he proved that God was vouching for the truth of His teaching. Hence, the Catholic Church has always held that Jesus Christ is true God. In other words, He is a divine Person-the second Person of the Blessed Trinity- possessing two distinct natures, the nature of God and the nature of man. His human nature is exactly like ours, consisting of body and soul with all its faculties. However, because of His divine personality certain imperfections to which we are subject could not be in His human nature. Thus, He could not have any sin, nor even any inclination to sin; neither could He be ignorant of any truth which it was fitting for Him to know. He was "full of grace and truth," as St. says-enriched with the fullest measure of supernatural grace and virtue, and even in His human intellect endowed with a knowledge of all things that were or ever had been or ever were to be. Since the actions proceeding from a nature are truly the actions of the person possessing that nature, all the actions proceeding from the human nature of Jesus Christ are truly the actions of God, the second Person of the Holy Trinity. Thus, we can correctly say: God walked on earth, God suffered, God died.
    
- This is the great mystery of the Incarnation-which means "the being made flesh," because God took human nature, the most noticeable part of which is the body. Around this mystery Catholic faith and devotion are chiefly centered. The Gospel, the most important portion of the New Testament, relates the earthly life of Jesus Christ. Catholics are urged to read it and to ponder its lessons. Above all, the Incarnation is a manifestation of God's love for us, inasmuch as He could give us no more exalted Saviour than His only Son. "God so loved the world that he gave His only-begotten Son" (John 3:16).
