## Lesson 15: The Two Great Commandments `(Hai Điều Răn Lớn)`

### Q. 188. Besides believing what God has revealed, what else must we do to be saved?

**A.** Besides believing what God has revealed, we must keep His law.

- God has clearly revealed that we must keep His law to attain eternal salvation. The revealed doctrines, which we must believe, give us the reasons for obeying the law.
- The law of God is an expression of divine wisdom guiding man to his end and regulating man's relations to his Creator and to his fellow men. Some actions are good in themselves; others are good because they are commanded. Some actions are evil in themselves; others are evil because they are forbidden. Good actions are in conformity with human nature as created by God; evil actions are contrary to it. The law of God presupposes the divine will and also divine wisdom. Every rational creature must obey the law of God as made known through human reason and divine revelation.

> `"If you love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15).`

> `"He who has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me" (John 14:21).`

> `"But if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments" (Matthew 19:17).`

### Q. 189. Which are the two great commandments that contain the whole law of God?

**A.** The two great commandments that contain the whole law of God are: first, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole mind, and with thy whole strength; second, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.

- The whole law of God can be reduced to the commandment of love of God, because the proper motive of love of neighbor and love of self is God.
- The first three commandments of the Decalogue refer directly to the commandment of love of God; the last seven regard the love of neighbor and imply love of oneself. Every person who has received or is capable of receiving sanctifying grace and eternal happiness is our neighbor. Only the devils and the souls of the damned are excluded from our love. 22

> `"And one of them, a doctor of the Law, putting him to the test, asked him, 'Master, which is the great commandment in the Law?' Jesus said to him. 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole mind.'`  
> `"This is the greatest and the first commandment. And the second is like it, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." On these two commandments depend the whole Law and the Prophets' " (Matthew 22:35-40).`

### Q. 190. What must we do to love God, our neighbor, and ourselves?

**A.** To love God, our neighbor, and ourselves we must keep the commandments of God and of the Church, and perform the spiritual and corporal works of mercy.

- Just as the commandments of God determine in detail what we must do in order to love God, our neighbor, and ourselves, so the commandments of the Church and the spiritual and corporal works of mercy show us how to apply practically the commandments of God.
- God, through His Divine Son Jesus Christ, empowered and directed the Catholic Church to make necessary and useful laws for its members to help them attain their eternal salvation. We prove our true love for our fellow man by performing the corporal and spiritual works of mercy, which should have as their motive the love of God and not merely humanitarian or natural reasons.

> `"Give alms out of thy substance, and turn not away thy face from any poor person: for so it shall come to pass that the face of the Lord shall not be turned from thee" (Tobias 4:7).`

> `"Let love be without pretense. Hate what is evil, hold to what is good. Love one another with fraternal charity, anticipating one another with honor. Be not slothful in zeal; be fervent in spirit, serving the Lord, rejoicing in hope. Be patient in tribulation, persevering in prayer. Share the needs of the saints, practicing hospitality. Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep. Be of one mind towards one another. Do not set your mind on high things but condescend to the lowly. Be not wise in your own conceits. To no man render evil for evil but provide good things not only in the sight of God, but also in the sight of all men. If it be possible, as far as in you lies, be at peace with all men. Do not avenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to the wrath, for it is written, 'Vengeance is mine; I will repay, says the Lord' " (Romans 12:9-19).`

> `"Brethren, even if a person is caught doing something wrong, you who are spiritual instruct such a one in a spirit of meekness, considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. Bear one another's burdens, and so you will fulfill the law of Christ" (Galatians 6:1-2).`

> `"And we exhort you, brethren, reprove the irregular, comfort the fainthearted, support the weak, and be patient towards all men. See that no one renders evil for evil to any man; but always strive after good towards one another and towards all men" (1 Thessalonians 5:14-15).`

> `"I urge therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all men" (1 Timothy 2:1).`

> `"Religion pure and undefiled before God the Father is this: to give aid to orphans and widows in their tribulation, and to keep oneself unspotted from this world" (James 1:27).`

> `"My brethren, if any one of you strays from the truth and someone brings him back, he ought to know that he who causes a sinner to be brought back from his misguided way, will save his soul from death, and will cover a multitude of sins" (James 5:19-20).`

> `"My dear children, let us not love in word, neither with the tongue, but in deed and in truth" (1 John 3:18).`

### Q. 191. Which are the chief corporal works of mercy?

**A.** The chief corporal works of mercy are seven:

1.  To feed the hungry.
2.  To give drink to the thirsty.
3.  To clothe the naked.
4.  To visit the imprisoned.
5.  To shelter the homeless.
6.  To visit the sick.
7.  To bury the dead.

- Our Lord taught explicitly that one can earn the eternal reward of heaven by performing the corporal works of mercy and that those who deliberately refuse to perform such works will be barred from heaven. One can feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, clothe the naked, and shelter the homeless not only by actually providing the necessities of life but also by working to correct economic abuses which cause unnecessary unemployment and poverty. Those who work to provide comfortable and sanitary housing for the poor perform a corporal work of mercy.
- One can visit the sick by paying a social call or by providing the necessary medical care as far as means and circumstances permit. Those who help support hospitals for the poor and home-nursing organizations also perform this work of mercy. Doctors and nurses who attend the sick can gain the reward promised by Our Lord if they perform their duties for the love of God and not merely for money or for humanitarian reasons.
- That Almighty God is pleased to reward those who bury the dead is distinctly taught in the book of Tobias. To visit a house of mourning or to attend a funeral is a mark of respect to the dead and a consolation to the relatives of the deceased person.
- The Church has forbidden cremation not because it is wrong in itself nor because it is contrary to divine law, but because it is in opposition to the Jewish and Christian tradition and has been advocated by anti-Christians with the express purpose of destroying belief in the immortality of the soul and the resurrection of the body. The Fathers of the Church defended the custom of burial by reason of the doctrine of the resurrection of the body and the respect due to it as the temple of the Holy Ghost.
- During great pestilences when it is impossible to bury the dead in time to prevent the spread of contagion, the Church permits mass cremation because it is neither wrong in itself nor expressly forbidden by the divine law.

### Q. 192. Which are the chief spiritual works of mercy?

**A.** The chief spiritual works of mercy are seven:

1.  To admonish the sinner.
2.  To instruct the ignorant.
3.  To counsel the doubtful.
4.  To comfort the sorrowful.
5.  To bear wrongs patiently.
6.  To forgive all injuries.
7.  To pray for the living and the dead.

- The spiritual works of mercy by their very nature excel the corporal works. They refer directly to the soul of man and to his eternal welfare. They are aids in healing the soul and in preserving it from spiritual disease; they help to foster the true happiness of mankind and are the most perfect fulfillment of the command to love our neighbor.
- We are obliged to admonish the sinner and to try to persuade him to turn from evil and to practice virtue whenever prudence dictates. We are not obliged to do so when, for example, we judge that our words will not be heeded or that greater harm will follow. Persons in authority, for example, parents and teachers, have a greater obligation than others in this regard. Sinners may be admonished not only by kind words but also by good example.
- Teachers in Catholic schools, missionaries, catechists, confessors, and Catholic writers perform in an excellent manner the spiritual work of instructing the ignorant. Those who help to support Catholic schools, colleges, and missions, as well as those who teach merely secular subjects, perform this spiritual work of mercy provided the motive of their actions is love of God and neighbor.
- Whenever their words are likely to be heeded, Christians must be ready to give helpful advice to those who need it.
- To console those who are in sorrow because of the death or sickness of loved ones or because of some other spiritual or temporal affliction is an act of Christian charity.
- The true Christian imitates the example of Christ by bearing wrongs patiently and by forgiving all injuries because of love of God. While dying on the cross, Christ prayed to His heavenly Father to forgive His executioners "for they do not know what they are doing" (Luke 23:34). The true Christian loves all men, even those who reproach and persecute him.
- The sublime doctrines of the Communion of Saints and the Mystical Body of Christ should make us pray for all our brothers in Christ.

### Q. 193. Is everyone obliged to perform the works of mercy?

**A.** Everyone is obliged to perform the works of mercy, according to his own ability and the need of his neighbor.

- The obligation to perform the works of mercy varies with one's vocation and condition of life and the degree of the neighbor's need.

### Q. 194. Are all the ordinary deeds done every day to relieve the corporal or spiritual needs of others true works of mercy?

**A.** All the ordinary deeds done every day to relieve the corporal or spiritual needs of others are true works of mercy, if done in the name of Christ.

- We can make all the good works done for our neighbor supernatural by doing them in the name of Christ and for the love of God.

> `"For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you are Christ's, amen I say to you, he shall not lose his reward" (Mark 9:40).`

> `"Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or do anything else, do all for the glory of God" (1 Corinthians 10:31).`

### Q. 195. Which are the commandments of God?

**A.** The commandments of God are these ten:

1.  I am the Lord thy God; thou shalt not have strange gods before Me.
2.  Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.
3.  Remember thou keep holy the Lord's Day.
4.  Honor thy father and thy mother.
5.  Thou shalt not kill.
6.  Thou shalt not commit adultery.
7.  Thou shalt not steal.
8.  Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
9.  Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife.
10. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods.

- These commandments, engraved on two tablets of stone, were given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai. In giving these commandments God made plain and determined the obligations which arise from man's very nature.

> And the Lord spoke all these words:
> 
> "I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
> 
> "Thou shalt not have strange gods before me.
> 
> "Thou shalt not make to thyself a graven thing, nor the likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, nor of those things that are in the waters under the earth.
> 
> "Thou shalt not adore them, nor serve them: I am the Lord thy God, mighty, jealous, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me:
> 
> "And showing mercy unto thousands to them that love me, and keep my commandments.
> 
> "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that shall take the name of the Lord his God in vain.
> 
> "Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day.
> 
> "Six days shalt thou labor, and shalt do all thy works.
> 
> "But on the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: thou shalt do no work on it, thou nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy beast, nor the stranger that is within thy gates.
> 
> "For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all things that are in them, and rested on the seventh day: therefore the Lord blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it.
> 
> "Honor thy father and thy mother, that thou mayest be long-lived upon the land which the Lord thy God will give thee.
> 
> "Thou shalt not kill.
> 
> "Thou shalt not commit adultery.
> 
> "Thou shalt not steal.
> 
> "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
> 
> "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house: neither shalt thou desire his wife, nor his servant, nor his handmaid, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is his" (Exodus 20:1-17).

> `"Do not think that I have come to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to destroy, but to fulfill. For amen I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, not one jot or one tittle shall be lost from the Law till all things have been accomplished. Therefore whoever does away with one of these least commandments, and so teaches men, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever carries them out and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 5:17-19).`

### Q. 196. Should we be satisfied merely to keep the commandments of God?

**A.** We should not be satisfied merely to keep the commandments of God, but should always be ready to do good deeds, even when they are not commanded.

- The commandments of God state the minimum requirements for salvation. They should be kept not merely according to the letter but also according to the spirit, which obliges us to strive for greater perfection.

> `"And behold, a certain man came to him and said, 'Good Master, what good work shall I do to have eternal life?' He said to him, 'Why dost thou ask me about what is good? One there is who is good, and he is God. But if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.' He said to him, 'Which?' And Jesus said,`
> 
> `Thou shalt not kill,`
> 
> `Thou shalt not commit adultery,`
> 
> `Thou shalt not steal,`
> 
> `Thou shalt not bear false witness, Honor thy father and mother, and, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."'`
> 
> `The young man said to him, 'All these I have kept; what is yet wanting to me?' Jesus said to him, 'If thou wilt be perfect, go, sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.' But when the young man heard the saying, he went away sad, for he had great possessions' " (Matthew 19:16-22).`

### Q. 197. What does Our Saviour especially recommend that is not strictly commanded by the law of God?

**A.** Our Saviour especially recommends the observance of the Evangelical Counsels-voluntary poverty, perpetual chastity, and perfect obedience.

- These recommendations are called counsels because, although they extend an invitation to all, the obligation to practice them is assumed voluntarily. They are called evangelical because they are recommended in the Gospel
- The Evangelical Counsels are the most perfect of the many counsels recommended in the Gospel; they remove impediments to sanctity and are positive helps to greater holiness. The observance of voluntary poverty enables a person to overcome the inclinations of greed; the observance of perpetual chastity helps in conquering the flesh; the observance of perfect obedience demands the entire subjection of the will.
- The obligations of the Evangelical Counsels are assumed by the vows of the religious life, which is called the life of perfection. Those who make these vows do not thereby become perfect but they assume the obligation of tending toward perfection in a special way.
- Any Catholic may voluntarily seek admission to the religious life who is free from legal impediments, has the right intention, and is fitted to discharge the duties of the particular institute of his choice. Married persons, and persons under fifteen years of age, as well as those whose parents need their help, are prevented by legal impediments from embracing the religious state. A person who wishes to please God, to save his soul, or to help his neighbor has a right intention in seeking admission to the religious state. The novitiate of the religious life is a period during which a vocation is tested and superiors and subjects are enabled to decide freely on the mutual obligations that are assumed by public profession in the religious state. By profession, members of the religious life publicly assume the obligations of their state through the vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. These obligations are assumed for a definite period or for life.
- Persons who do not embrace the religious life can tend toward perfection in their particular state by observing the spirit of the Evangelical Counsels. The spirit of poverty will make them freely give up many needless things in order to help the poor. Married persons will strive to govern their lives by marital chastity, realizing that they can place limitation of their family only through virtuous living. The spirit of obedience will make them docile to legitimate superiors, in whom they will see the representatives of God.

> `"You therefore are to be perfect, even as your heavenly Father is perfect" (Matthew 5:48).`

> `"And Peter`

> *Poverty-See Scripture, question 196, Matthew 19:16-22.*  
> *Chastity-"He who is unmarried is concerned about the things of the Lord, how he may please God" (1 Corinthians 7:32).*  
> *Obedience -"For obedience is better than sacrifices" (1 Kings 15:22).*

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT THE TWO GREAT COMMANDMENTS

- "Faith without works is dead" (James 2:26), says the apostle, St. James. This same lesson was taught by Our Lord when He said "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord' shall enter the kingdom of heaven; but he who does the will of my Father in heaven shall enter the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 7:21). In other words, we are obliged not only to believe all that God has revealed, but also to obey all that He commands.
    
- Our reason tells us that certain things are good and obligatory, such as worshiping God and obeying our parents, while other things are bad and sinful, such as theft or murder. These obligations and prohibitions make up the natural law. To know this we need no revelation; yet, because human beings through ignorance and malice are apt to go astray even in this law, God gave the Israelites the Ten Commandments, which explicitly contain the chief obligations of the natural law, and implicitly contain all the rest. Thus, the fourth commandment explicitly commands children to honor their parents; yet it surely implies other obligations, such as love, respect and obedience, as also the duties of parents toward their children. God also laid down certain other laws for the people of Israel in addition to the natural law, such as the prohibition to eat certain kinds of food (). These constitute what we call the positive law. It is evident that God, Creator and Lord of all mankind, has a right to make any laws He wills, and men have the obligation to obey them.
    
- It should be noted that the enumeration of the Ten Commandments differs in the Catholic Church from that followed by most Protestants. What is the first commandment for Catholics is divided into two commandments by Protestants, while the ninth and tenth commandments of Catholics form only one commandment for Protestants, so that our commandments from the second to the ninth are numbered one higher by Protestants.
    
- Our Lord emphasized the necessity of obeying the natural law. He Himself also added some positive laws for all mankind, such as the obligation to enter His Church. He did away with the ceremonial laws of the Jewish people, such as the laws regarding the types of food that were forbidden and the observance of the Sabbath Day. In His law the prominent feature is love -love for God and love for our fellow men. That is why He said that all the laws of God could be summed up in the two commandments, to love God and to love our neighbor. For this same reason He wills that His followers shall not content themselves with merely obeying laws. He wishes them to do more than what is commanded. In the Christian religion the works of mercy, which are deeds of charity toward one's neighbor in his bodily or spiritual needs, are recommended to all. And to those who wish to practice Christian virtue in its highest forms our Saviour gave the counsels of perfection: poverty, chastity and obedience.
    
- These counsels are the basis of the religious state. There are hundreds of different orders and congregations, each doing its own particular work for God's glory, but all leading their members nearer to God by the constant practice of Christian virtue. Some female religious teach, others care for the sick and the aged and orphans, others devote themselves entirely to prayer in the seclusion of their convents. Some male religious are priests; others are brothers. And the Church is ever holding the religious life before Catholic boys and girls as the most perfect way in which one may serve God and our neighbor and the surest way of winning the happiness of heaven.
    
- Sometimes young folks feel a desire for the life of holiness which the religious state offers, but they fear that they have no vocation to this sublime state. It is possible that they entertain a false notion about a vocation. They seem to imagine that those who are called to the religious life receive a clear internal inspiration, inviting them to the monastery or the convent. On this point they are entirely mistaken. The very fact that a person has the requisite qualities of body and of soul to fulfill the duties of the religious life and feels an inclination toward this form of life can be regarded as an indication that he has a vocation and that he may lawfully seek admission to an order or congregation. During the novitiate he will have a sufficient opportunity to judge whether or not he is called to the religious state.
    
- Today there is great need of candidates for the religious life, especially of those who will devote themselves to works of charity, such as the care of the sick and the education of children. The spirit of the age, so eager for material wealth and pleasures and honors, is indeed the very opposite of the religious spirit of poverty and self-denial and humility. But the very fact that there is so great a difference between the world and the cloister reflects great credit and merit on those who enter the religious life.
    
- Young folks who think that they may have a religious vocation should pray fervently for divine guidance, read good books on the religious state, and consult an experienced confessor.

## Lesson 16: The First Commandment of God `(Điều Răn thứ Nhất của Thiên Chúa)`

### Q. 198. What is the first commandment of God?

**A.** The first commandment of God is: I am the Lord thy God; thou shalt not have strange gods before Me.

- The first commandment forbids idolatry that is, offering to a creature the supreme worship due to God alone. Idolatry is sinful because God alone has a right to supreme worship as the Creator and Preserver of all things. The first commandment also forbids us to ascribe to a creature any of the attributes that belong to God alone.

> `"Thou shalt not have strange gods before me. Thou shalt not make to thyself a graven thing, nor the likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, nor of those things that are in the waters under the earth" (Exodus 20:3-4).`

### Q. 199. What are we commanded by the first commandment?

**A.** By the first commandment we are commanded to offer to God alone the supreme worship that is due Him.

> `"And Jesus answered and said to him, 'It is written, "The Lord thy God shalt thou worship, and him only shalt thou serve" ' " (Luke 4:8).`

> `"For from him and through him and unto him are all things. To him be the glory forever, amen" (Romans 11:36).`

### Q. 200. How do we worship God?

**A.** We worship God by acts of faith, hope, and charity, and by adoring Him and praying to Him.

- We worship God by an act of faith when we firmly assent to the truth of God's revelation, on the word of God revealing, who can neither deceive nor be deceived. We worship God by an act of hope when we firmly trust that God who is all-powerful and faithful to His promises, will in His mercy give us eternal happiness and the means to obtain it.
- We worship God by an act of charity when we love God above all things for His own sake and our neighbor as ourselves for the love of God. We adore God by acknowledging His infinite excellence, our complete dependence upon Him, and our total subjection to His will. We pray to God by lifting up our minds and hearts to Him. 24
- of faith, hope, charity, adoration, and prayer may be internal or external. They are internal when they are only in our mind or heart; they are external when they are manifested outwardly by signs or words. External worship is an outward manifestation of our internal convictions and sentiments.
- External worship is necessary because we are bound to render to God the homage of our bodies and because it serves to preserve, increase, and express internal worship. Man is composed of body and soul, and the body can and does aid the soul in its operations. We are moved to be more devout in our internal acts of worship by sacred music, art, public and private recitation of prayers, and the ceremonies of the liturgy.

### Q. 201. What does faith oblige us to do?

**A.** Faith obliges us: first, to make efforts to find out what God has revealed; second, to believe firmly what God has revealed; third, to profess our faith openly whenever necessary.

- God, whose power and knowledge are infinite, can reveal supernatural truths to man. Every man who knows or suspects that he does not profess the religion revealed by God is under the obligation of seeking it and, when he has found it, of embracing it.
- Whoever has attained the use of reason must make an interior act of faith: first, when he comes to the knowledge of divine revelation or becomes certain of a dogma of the Church; second, when he, having rejected the errors of infidelity or heresy, recognizes the obligation of believing the Catholic religion; third, when an act of faith is necessary to resist temptations against faith, or another virtue; fourth, often during life.
- A Catholic is bound to profess his faith openly: first, whenever the honor due to God requires it; for example, when his failure to profess his faith openly would be equivalent to a denial of faith; second, when the good of his neighbor requires it.

### Q. 202. What does hope oblige us to do?

**A.** Hope obliges us to trust firmly that God will give us eternal life and the means to obtain it.

- An act of hope must be made: first, when a person comes to a knowledge of God's existence and his own destiny, namely, eternal happiness in heaven; second, when it is necessary to resist temptations against the virtue of hope or some other virtue; third, after the virtue of hope is lost by a sin opposed to it, that is, by despair or presumption; fourth, often during life.

> `"Paul, a servant of God and apostle of Jesus Christ, in accordance with the faith of God's elect and the full knowledge of the truth which is according to piety, in the hope of life everlasting which God, who does not lie, promised before the ages began-" (Titus 1:1-2).`

### Q. 203. What does charity oblige us to do?

**A.** Charity obliges us to love God above all things because He is infinitely good, and to love our neighbor as ourselves for the love of God.

- An act of charity must be made: first, when a person comes to the realization of the duty of loving God above all things and his neighbor as himself for the love of God; second, when temptation can be overcome only by an act of charity; third, at the hour of death; fourth, often during life.

> *`See Scripture, question 189, Matthew 22:35-40.`*

### Q. 204. How can a Catholic best safeguard his faith?

**A.** A Catholic can best safeguard his faith by making frequent acts of faith, by praying for a strong faith, by studying his religion very earnestly, by living a good life, by good reading, by refusing to associate with the enemies of the Church, and by not reading books and papers opposed to the Church and her teaching.

### Q. 205. How does a Catholic sin against faith?

**A.** A Catholic sins against faith by apostasy, heresy, indifferentism, and by taking part in non-Catholic worship.

- Apostasy is the complete abandonment of the Christian faith by those who have been baptized.
- Heresy is the refusal of baptized persons, retaining the name Christian, to accept one or more of the truths revealed by God and taught by the Catholic Church. If this refusal is voluntary and obstinate, it is formal heresy; if it is involuntary, it is material heresy.
- Indifferentism is the error of those who hold that one religion is as good as another and that all religions are equally true and pleasing to God, or that one is free to accept or reject any or all religions.
- Those take part in the worship of non-Catholics who join in the irreligious services. Attendance at non-Catholic religious services, provided no part is taken in such worship, is allowed for a sufficiently grave reason, for example, presence at a non-Catholic funeral or a marriage ceremony for social reasons.
- Infidelity is also a sin against faith. It is the unbelief of those to whom the truths of faith have been sufficiently proposed but who nevertheless deliberately refuse to accept them.

> *Apostasy: See Scripture, question 201, Matthew 10:32-33.*

> *Heresy: "I know that after my departure fierce wolves will get in among you and will not spare the flock. And from among your own selves men will rise speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them" (Acts 20:29-30).*

> *Infidelity: See Scripture, question 107, John 3:5, question 158, Mark 16:15-16.*

### Q. 206. Why does a Catholic sin against faith by taking part in non-Catholic worship?

**A.** A Catholic sins against faith by taking part in non-Catholic worship because he thus professes belief in a religion he knows is false.

> `"Jesus said to him, 'I am the way, and the truth, and the life' " (John 14:6).`

> `"Pilate therefore said to him, 'Thou art then a king?' Jesus answered, 'Thou sayest it; I am a king. This is why I was born, and why I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice' " (John 18:37).`

### Q. 207. What are the sins against hope?

**A.** The sins against hope are presumption and despair.

### Q. 208. When does a person sin by presumption?

**A.** A person sins by presumption when he trusts that he can be saved by his own efforts without God's help, or by God's help without his own efforts.

> `"Nay I do not even judge my own self. For I have nothing on my conscience, yet I am not thereby justified" (1 Corinthians 4:4).`

> `"Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall" (1 Corinthians 10:12).`

> `"For he is not approved who commends himself, but he whom the Lord commends" (2 Corinthians 10:18).`

### Q. 209. When does a person sin by despair?

**A.** A person sins by despair when he deliberately refuses to trust that God will give him the necessary help to save his soul.

> `"Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders, saying, 'I have sinned in betraying innocent blood ...' And he hung the pieces of silver into the temple, and withdrew; and went away and hanged himself with a halter" (Matthew 27:3-5).`

> `"My dear children, these things I write to you in order that you may not sin. But if anyone sins, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the just; and he is a propitiation for our sins, not for ours only but also for those of the Whole world" (1 John 2:1-2).`

> `"May no temptation take hold of you but such as man is equal to. God is faithful and will not permit you to be tempted beyond your strength, but with the temptation will also give you a way out that you may be able to bear it" (1 Corinthians 10:13).`

### Q. 210. What are the chief sins against charity?

**A.** The chief sins against charity are hatred of God and of our neighbor, envy, sloth, and scandal.

- When a person hates another, he wishes him evil or rejoices in his misfortune. One who hates God wishes evil to befall Him, if that were possible, or wishes grievous sins to be committed, or rejoices in sin as an insult to God. Hatred of God is the most grievous offense against Him and is always a mortal sin.
- A person who hates his neighbor wishes him harm or rejoices when evil befalls him. To wish a neighbor serious harm is a mortal sin; for example, to wish another's damnation. To wish a neighbor a slight evil or to hold a slight aversion for him is a venial sin. It is not a sin to wish some temporal misfortune to overtake another in order that he may be converted or cease to do harm. Nor is it sinful to wish another's death, under the condition that it be in accord with God's will; for example, to wish a person's death so that he will be relieved of great suffering, or because he is a menace to society or is likely to inflict grave harm on an innocent person, or because he deserves death by reason of crime.
- Envy is sadness at another's good fortune which is considered to be detracting from one's own excellence. Sadness at another's prosperity is not envy when it is caused by a neighbor's using his advantage to harm us, or when another is unreasonably and unjustly preferred to us. 25
- Sloth is distaste for spiritual things because their attainment requires much labor. 26
- Scandal is any word, act, or omission that is in itself evil or has the appearance of evil and which can be the occasion of another's sin. Scandal may be given even though no sin follows. A person who has already determined to sin or a person who cannot be led into sin cannot be scandalized. Scandal is direct when a word, act, or omission is intended to lead another to sin. Scandal is indirect when it is foreseen that one's word, act, or omission is likely to be the occasion of another's sin, even though such is not intended.

> *Envy: "Charity does not envy" (1 Corinthians 13:4).*

> *Sloth: "But we want every one of you to show to the very end the same earnestness for the fulfillment of your hopes; so that you may become sluggish but imitators of those who by faith and patience will inherit the promises" (Hebrews 6:11-12).*

> `"Be not slothful in zeal; be fervent in spirit, serving the Lord" (Romans 12:11).`

> *Scandal: "Woe to the world because of scandals! For it must needs be that scandals come, but woe to the man through whom scandal does come!" (Matthew 18:7).*

### Q. 211. Besides the sins against faith, hope, and charity, what other sins does the first commandment forbid?

**A.** Besides the sins against faith, hope, and charity, the first commandment forbids also superstition and sacrilege.

### Q. 212. When does a person sin by superstition?

**A.** A person sins by superstition when he attributes to a creature a power that belongs to God alone, as when he makes use of charms or spells, believes in dreams or fortune-telling, or goes to spiritists.

- Superstition is by its nature a mortal sin, but it may be venial either when the matter is slight or when there is a lack of full consent to the act. Often this sin is not mortal when there is question of certain popular superstitions, for example, belief in unlucky days and numbers, or when superstitious acts are performed as a joke without any serious thought of attributing divine powers to a creature, or when these acts are performed for amusement.

> `"Neither let there be found among you anyone that ... consulteth soothsayers, or observeth dreams and omens. Neither let there be any wizard, nor charmer, nor anyone that consulteth pythonic spirits, or fortune tellers: or that seeketh the truth from the dead. For the Lord abhorreth all these things: and for these abominations he will destroy them" (Deuteronomy 18:10-12).`

### Q. 213. When does a person sin by sacrilege?

**A.** A person sins by sacrilege when he mistreats sacred persons, places, or things.

- To mistreat a person consecrated to God in the clerical or religious state of life is a personal sacrilege. The violation of places dedicated to divine worship by the public authority of the Church, for example, churches and chapels, is a local sacrilege. The misuse or violation of sacred things for example, the sacraments, the Holy Scriptures, or objects consecrated or blessed for divine worship or devotion, as chalices and statues, etc., is a real sacrilege. Sacrilege, of its nature, is a grievous sin, but it may be venial either because the matter is slight or because there is lack of full consent to the act.

> `"They have set thy sanctuary ablaze, they have profaned the dwelling of thy name on the earth. They said in their heart: 'Let us destroy them all together; burn ye all God's sanctuaries in the land' " (Psalm 73:7-8).`

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT THE 1st COMMANDMENT OF GOD

- Many persons believe that in order to lead a good life one has only to act justly and charitably toward his fellow men. Such persons do not realize that the most important of man's obligations are those toward his Creator. The chief of these obligations are those laid down in the first three commandments. The first commandment prescribes our fundamental duty as creatures-the adoration of God-and forbids those things that are opposed to it.
    
- To obey the first commandment we must especially practice those virtues which have God Himself as their immediate object, the theological virtues. We should frequently make acts of these virtues. Although every practical Catholic, without thinking expressly of these virtues, makes acts of faith, hope and charity when he performs his religious duties, such as attendance at Mass, the reception of the sacraments, prayer, etc., it is advisable for every-one to make acts of the theological virtues in a more express manner at certain times. The most convenient occasion is when we say our night prayers.
    
- Sins against the first commandment are very common nowadays. Besides the great multitude of persons who deliberately reject belief in God and Christ, there are many who will not accept the Catholic religion, even though they see the force of the arguments the Catholic Church presents to show that it is the true Church of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Many of these persons are moved by the thought of the difficulties and the sacrifices that are connected with the Catholic religion, such as the stricter observance of the moral code, confession, and the laws of fast and abstinence. These persons often try to justify themselves with the statement that one religion is as good as another; but this is ridiculous, because there can be only one true religion, and surely false religions cannot be as good as that which is true.
    
- Unfortunately, there are even Catholics who violate the first commandment-some by sins against hope and charity, some even by sins against faith. It is true, there are few Catholics who after being instructed in their religion, go so far as to doubt or deny any of the Church's teachings. Even those unfortunate persons who leave the Catholic Church are generally led to make this decision, not by difficulties concerning the faith but by desire of worldly success or the intention of marrying a divorced person, or some other unworthy material motive. But there are Catholics who are more or less seriously addicted to superstitious practices, such as avoiding thirteen at table, reading tea-leaves, knocking on wood, etc. Some even engage in more serious superstitious practices, such as consulting fortune tellers or spiritistic mediums. These practices are a violation of the first commandment of God, inasmuch as they attribute to created things powers that God reserves to Himself.
    
- The most important truths of revelation, which every-one should know explicitly as a means of salvation, are these four: (1) God exists; (2) God rewards the good and punishes the wicked; (3) God is one in nature and three in Persons; (4) The second Person of the Holy Trinity became man and died for our salvation, rose from the dead and ascended into heaven, whence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.
    
- Catholics should be on their guard against the sin of sacrilege, such as the lack of proper reverence in church, jokes concerning the Bible or other sacred things, disrespectful use of holy water or blessed medals, etc. Generally such sins are only venial; but a person is guilty of the mortal sin of sacrilege when there is a question of the unworthy reception of a sacrament. By far the worst example of this kind is the unworthy reception of the Holy Eucharist.

## Lesson 17: Honoring the Saints, Relics, and Images `(Tôn kính các Thánh, Di vật, và Hình ảnh)`

### Q. 214. Does the first commandment forbid us to honor the saints in heaven?

**A.** The first commandment does not forbid us to honor the saints in heaven, provided we do not give them the honor that belongs to God alone.

- A saint, in the strict sense of the word, is a person who is declared officially by the Church to be in heaven and who may be publicly venerated.
- The veneration paid to the saints in heaven differs essentially from the adoration of God. The saints are creatures and are not to be given the supreme worship due to the Creator alone. The supreme honor given to God only is adoration in the full and strict sense of the word. The veneration given to the Blessed Mother and to the saints is an act of respect and honor of an entirely different nature. The veneration given to the Blessed Mother of God surpasses that given to the saints and angels.

> `"Behold I will send my angel ... Take notice of him and hear his voice, and do not think him one to be contemned" (Exodus 23:20-21).`

> `"And he answered: No: but I am prince of the host of the Lord, and now I am come. fell on his face to the ground. And worshipping, said: What saith my Lord to his servant?" (Josue 5:14-15).`

> `"Let us now praise men of renown, and our fathers in their generation" (Ecclesiasticus 44:1).`

> `"Then Jesus said to him, 'Begone, Satan! for it is written, "The Lord thy God shalt thou worship and him only shalt thou serve" ' " (Matthew 4:10).`

> `"For, behold, henceforth all generations shall call me blessed" (Luke 1:48).`

### Q. 215. Why do we honor the saints in heaven?

**A.** We honor the saints in heaven because they practiced great virtue when they were on earth, and because in honoring those who are the chosen friends of God we honor God Himself.

### Q. 216. How can we honor the saints?

**A.** We can honor the saints: first, by imitating their holy lives; second, by praying to them; third, by showing respect to their relics and images.

> `"And Eliseus died, and they buried him. And the rovers from Moab came into the land the same year. And some that were burying a man, saw the rovers, and cast the body into the sepulchre of Eliseus. And when it had touched the bones of Eliseus, the man came to life, and stood upon his feet" (4 Kings 13:20-21).`

> `"Go to my servant ... .And my servant shall pray for you. His face I will accept" (Job 42:8).`

> `"And God worked more than the usual miracles by the hand of Paul; so that even handkerchiefs and aprons were carried from his body to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out" (Acts 19:11-12).`

> `"Brethren, be imitators of me, and mark those who walk after the pattern you have in us" (Philippians 3:17).`

### Q. 217. When we pray to the saints what do we ask them to do?

**A.** When we pray to the saints, we ask them to offer their prayers to God for us.

### Q. 218. How do we know that the saints will pray for us?

**A.** We know that the saints will pray for us because they are with God and have great love for us.

### Q. 219. Why do we honor relics?

**A.** We honor relics because they are the bodies of the saints or objects connected with the saints or with Our Lord.

- The honor given to a relic does not stop at the sacred object itself but is directed to the person whose relic is venerated.

*See Scripture, question 216, 4 Kings 13:20-21; Acts 19:11-12.*

### Q. 220. When does the first commandment forbid the making or the use of statues and pictures?

**A.** The first commandment forbids the making or the use of statues and pictures only when they promote false worship.

> `"Thou shalt not make to thyself a graven thing, nor the likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, nor of those things that are in the waters under the earth. Thou shalt not adore them, nor serve them" (Exodus 20:4-5).`

> `"Keep therefore your souls carefully. You saw not any similitude in the day that the Lord God spoke to you in Horeb from the midst of the fire: lest perhaps being deceived you might make you a graven similitude, or image of male or female, the similitude of any beasts, that are upon the earth, or of birds, that fly under heaven, or of creeping things, 'that move on the earth, or of fishes, that abide in the waters under the earth: lest perhaps lifting up thy eyes to heaven, thou see the sun and the moon, and all the stars of heaven, and being deceived by error thou adore and serve them, which the Lord thy God created for the service of all the nations, that are under heaven" (l5-19).`

### Q. 221. Is it right to show respect to the statues and pictures of Christ and of the saints?

**A.** It is right to show respect to the statues and pictures of Christ and of the saints, just as it is right to show respect to the images of those whom we honor or love on earth.

### Q. 222. Do we honor Christ and the saints when we pray before the crucifix, relics, and sacred images?

**A.** We honor Christ and the saints when we pray before the crucifix, relics, and sacred images because we honor the persons they represent; we adore Christ and venerate the saints.

### Q. 223. Do we pray to the crucifix or to the images and relics of the saints?

**A.** We do not pray to the crucifix or to the images and relics of the saints, but to the persons they represent.

- In venerating relics, statues, and pictures of Our Lord and the saints we must not believe that any divine power resides in them, nor should we put our trust in them as though they had the power of to bestow favors. We place our trust in God and the intercessory power of the saints.

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT HONORING THE SAINTS, RELICS AND IMAGES

- Devotion to the saints is one of the Catholic practices most misunderstood and most opposed by non-Catholics. Yet, it is a most reasonable devotion. If we truly love God, we shall love those who are dear to Him; and the saints in heaven are the souls most dear to God, united to Him for all eternity. Since they are so near to Him, their prayers are most effective, so we ask them to pray for us. We can have a particular devotion to certain saints, whose condition in life was similar to our own, or who we believe will show a special interest in us. Thus, the members of a religious order whose founder is among the canonized saints will naturally have a special devotion to this saint. All Catholics should have a special devotion to the Queen of Saints, the Blessed Virgin Mary.
    
- In the liturgy of the Catholic Church seven general classes of saints are distinguished-apostles, martyrs, popes, confessors who were bishops, confessors who were not bishops, virgins, and women who were not virgins. Thus, everyone can find saints whose state in life was like his own. It should be noted here that when we speak of a saint as a confessor we mean, not that he heard confessions, but that he openly confessed himself a follower of Christ.
    
- Naturally we cherish and venerate the images of the saints and their relics, just as the citizens of a nation respect and honor the images of the country's heroes and the articles they used in life. Catholics know full well that pictures and relics are only material things, incapable of helping us in our needs; but we find in them a means of inspiring us with pious affections, of reminding us of the saints, and of helping us to pray more devoutly. That is why every truly Catholic home has holy pictures on the walls or sacred images among the furnishings. Only lukewarm, cowardly Catholics are afraid to have such representations in their homes out of fear lest their non-Catholic friends may laugh at them.
    
- Of all holy images, the most sacred is the representation of Christ's death on the cross, the crucifix. This should find a place in every Catholic home, especially in every bedroom, so that the occupants may say their morning and night prayers before this reminder of God's great love for us. The most venerated relic of the Church is the Cross on which our Saviour died. The largest portion of this is kept in the Church of the Holy Cross in Rome, and small pieces are distributed to different churches throughout the world. Frequently a bishop carries a relic of the true Cross in the pectoral cross which he wears on his breast.
    
- The Church does not permit the public veneration of a relic unless it is properly encased and sealed and its authenticity supported by a document, signed by a bishop or other ecclesiastical dignitary. This does not mean necessarily that it is absolutely certain that the relic is genuine; but it means that reasonable care has been taken to establish the fact that the relic is a true one.
    
- There are three classes of relics-first-class relics, which are the bodies or portions of the bodies of the saints; second-class relics, which are articles used by a saint, such as his clothing or books; third-class relics, which are articles that have touched a first or second-class relic, such as the coffin in which the saint was buried.
    
- We honor the saints best by imitating their virtues. Every Catholic should be familiar with the lives of some of the saints, and especially of the saints whose names were given him or her in Baptism. Sometimes, indeed the saints performed extraordinary deeds, or actions which were not in accord with ordinary prudence. In these things we must not try to imitate them, for on those occasions they were especially inspired by God. But we can all imitate the spirit that animated the saints, especially their love for God and for their fellow-men. They were human beings like ourselves, subject to temptation; some of them had sinned gravely before they became saints. We are all called to be saints; for to all of us Our Lord said: "You therefore are to be perfect, even as your heavenly Father is perfect" (Matt. 5:48).

#### B. PROBLEMS AND EXERCISES

*(Answer the questions orally or write them as your teacher may direct):*

- Jay, a politician and a Presbyterian without much religion, ridicules the idea of Catholics honoring the saints. Write him a short letter asking him in a friendly way if he condemns patriotic Americans who pay their respects to George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln at the respective monuments to those outstanding citizens in Washington, D. C., and at other shrines erected to their memory throughout the nation. In a polite way, show him the reasonableness of our Catholic custom.
- Judith, a poorly-instructed Catholic, has great devotion to St. Anthony of Padua. She visits his shrine every day, rain or shine, even though on Sundays she sometimes misses Mass without a good excuse. She will spend from fifteen to forty-five minutes before St. Anthony's shrine, paying little or no attention to Our Lord in His Real Presence beyond a sort of curtsey as she enters or leaves the church. Is that well-regulated devotion? What advice would you give Judith?
- What do you consider well-regulated devotion towards the saints? Arrange the following saints in the order of your preference: St.
- Aloysius, St. Agnes, The Blessed Virgin Mary, the Little Flower, St. Anthony, St. Joseph, St. Patrick, St. Boniface, St. Francis Xavier, St. Francis of Assisi. Now from the foregoing list select three only, naming them in the order of your preference, together with a short reason why you rank them first, second, and third. If your favorite saint is not listed, you may supply that saint's name.
- Ambrose wants to know how to honor his patron saint. Can you tell him ways in which he can honor his great patron? How can he secure information about Saint Ambrose?
- St. Rose of Lima did some rather extraordinary things, such as cutting off her beautiful hair, observing an extremely rigorous Lenten fast, torturing her innocent flesh with sharp instruments of penance. Rose, a schoolgirl of 11, would like to know if she should do the things her illustrious patron did. What answer are you going to give her?
- Eric inquires whether or not the prayers he offers to St. Ann eventually reach God. What is your reply to Eric? Explain it.
- Anna has a tiny bone relic of the Little Flower of Jesus; Winifred has a piece of her Carmelite habit; Vivian, a small square of linen that was touched to one of the Saint's prayer books. Classify each relic.
- Jeremiah's family are moving into a new house. They leave behind them many old and worn out things, among them a picture of the Holy Family. They take with them the frame, but the picture itself is thrown in with the rubbish. Write three or four sentences to Jerry telling him what you think about the treatment of the discarded picture, and what you would have done under the same circumstances.
- On your own person do you habitually carry any religious image? Give at least two reasons why you think it is a good practice.
- What religious image is appropriate in the bedrooms of our homes?
- Marcella, a newlywed, says it is fashionable nowadays not to ornament the walls of one's home with pictures of any kind. What reply can be made to Marcella?

## Lesson 18: The Second and Third Commandments of God `(Điều Răn thứ Hai và thứ Ba của Thiên Chúa)`

### Q. 224. What is the second commandment of God?

**A.** The second commandment of God is: Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.

> `"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that shall take the name of the Lord his God in vain" (Exodus 20:7).`

### Q. 225. What are we commanded by the second commandment?

**A.** By the second commandment we are commanded always to speak with reverence of God, of the saints, and of holy things, and to be truthful in taking oaths and faithful to them and to our vows.

- When we honor a name; we actually honor the person or thing related to the name. We reverence God's name: first, by using it reverently in prayer; second, by bowing the head or tipping the hat at the name of Jesus; third, by speaking reverently of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the angels, the saints, the Church, and persons, places, or things dedicated to the service of God; fourth, by public manifestations of reverence, such as rallies, parades, and processions proclaiming the divinity of Christ, devotion to His Blessed Mother, and the recitation of the Divine Praises.

> `"Blessed be the name of the Lord both now and forever. From the rising of the sun unto its going down, may the name of the Lord be praised" (Psalm 112:2-3).`

### Q. 226. What is an oath?

**A.** An oath is the calling on God to witness to the truth of what we say.

> `"Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and shalt serve him only: and thou shalt swear by his name" (Deuteronomy 6:13).`

> `"Now in what I am writing to you, behold, before God, I do not lie" (Galatians 1:20).`

> `"For men swear by one greater than themselves, and an oath given as a guarantee is the final settlement of all their disagreement" (Hebrews 6:16).`

### Q. 227. What things are necessary to make an oath lawful?

**A.** To make an oath lawful, these three things are necessary: first, we must have a good reason for taking an oath; second, we must be convinced that what we say under oath is true; third, we must not swear, that is, take an oath to do what is wrong.

- An oath reverently taken is a meritorious act of divine worship; otherwise, it is sinful. It is lawful to take an oath, that is, to swear, because an oath is a guarantee of truthfulness; it is useful in having our word accepted in matters which concern the glory of God or the good of our neighbor or of ourselves. An oath, at times, is prescribed by civil or ecclesiastical authority. To take an oath without sufficient reason, or to swear rashly, is ordinarily a venial sin but can be a mortal sin if it is the occasion of perjury or scandal.
- The binding force of an oath arises from the virtues of veracity and religion. The obligation to fulfill a promise made under oath is grave or light, depending on the gravity of that which is promised. If we take an oath to do that which is wrong, useless, or impossible, we are obliged not to keep it.
- A promissory oath ceases to bind: first, if it is relaxed by the one to whom the promise was given; second, if the object of the promise changes substantially; third, if the object becomes sinful or useless; fourth, if the reason for making the oath ceases to exist; fifth, if a condition under which the oath was given ceases; sixth, if it is legitimately annulled, dispensed, or commuted.
- An oath to observe civil constitutions does not oblige us to obey laws which are opposed to divine or ecclesiastical right. We are not permitted to swear unconditional obedience to a constitution containing laws against justice or the divine law. One cannot, for example, swear to observe a civil constitution which prohibits the teaching of the religion of Christ.

> `"By my own self have I sworn, saith the Lord: Because thou hast done this thing, and hast not spared thy only begotten son for my sake" (Genesis 22:16).`

> `"And thou shalt swear: As the Lord liveth, in truth and in judgment and in justice" (Jeremias 4:2).`

### Q. 228. What great sin does a person commit who deliberately calls on God to bear witness to a lie?

**A.** A person who deliberately calls on God to bear witness to a lie commits the very grievous sin of perjury.

> `"The person that sweareth, and uttereth with his lips, that he would do either evil or good, and bindeth the same with an oath, and his word: and having forgotten it afterwards understandeth his offence, Let him do penance for his sin" (Leviticus 5:4-5).`

> `"Thou shalt not swear falsely by my name, nor profane the name of thy God" (Leviticus 19:12).`

> `"Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbor" (Deuteronomy 5:20).`

### Q. 229. What is a vow?

**A.** A vow is a deliberate promise made to God by which a person binds himself under pain of sin to do something that is especially pleasing to God.

- In making a vow, a person must act with freedom, knowledge, and deliberation, and with the intention of binding himself under pain of sin. What is promised by the vow must be possible, morally good, and better than it's contrary. We make vows to God alone, but we may make them to God in honor of the saints in order to have greater assurance of obtaining the favor which we seek. A vow, therefore, is an act of divine worship by which we acknowledge God's supreme dominion. Any act that pertains to a vow is an act of divine worship.
- Vows may be public or private. A public vow is one made before a legitimate ecclesiastical superior and accepted in the name of the Church.
- A private vow is made to God immediately without the intervention of an ecclesiastical superior authorized to receive it. A vow should never be made without due reflection and the advice of a prudent spiritual director. In making a vow a person should avoid haste and levity and should seriously consider the responsibility to be assumed.
- The obligation of a vow depends upon the gravity of the object of the vow and the intention of the person making it.

> `"When thou hast made a vow to the Lord thy God, thou shalt not delay to pay it: because the Lord thy God will require it. And if thou delay, it shall be imputed to thee for a sin" (Deuteronomy 23:21).`

> `"If thou hast vowed anything to God, defer not to pay it. For an unfaithful and foolish promise displeaseth him: but whatsoever thou hast vowed, pay it. And it is much better not to vow than after a vow not to perform the things promised" (Ecclesiastes 5:3-4).`

> *`See Scripture, question 224, Exodus 20:7.`*

### Q. 230. What is meant by taking God's name in vain?

**A.** By taking God's name in vain is meant that the name of God or the holy name of Jesus Christ is used without reverence: for example, to express surprise or anger.

> `"Bless the Lord, O my soul, and let all that is within me bless his holy name" (Psalm 102:1).`

> `"And let not the naming of God be usual in thy mouth, and meddle not with the names of saints: for thou shalt not escape free from them" (Ecclesiasticus 23:10).`

### Q. 231. Is it a sin to take God's name in vain?

**A.** It is a sin to take God's name in vain; ordinarily, it is a venial sin.

- To take God's name in vain is a mortal sin when it is done out of deliberate contempt for God, or when serious scandal may be given.

### Q. 232. What is cursing?

**A.** Cursing is the calling down of some evil on a person, place, or thing.

- Cursing is a mortal sin when a grave evil is deliberately willed. Cursing is a venial sin when it is done thoughtlessly or when only a slight evil is willed or when it is directed to animals or inanimate things.

> `"He that curseth his father, or mother, shall die the death" (Exodus 21:17).`

> `"And he loved cursing: may it come upon him; he would not have blessings: be it far from him. And may he be clothed with cursing as with a garment. (Psalm 108:17-18).`

> `"Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse" (Romans 12:14).`

> `"Out of the same mouth proceed blessing and cursing. These things, my brethren, ought not to be so" (James 3:10).`

### Q. 233. What is blasphemy?

**A.** Blasphemy is insulting language which expresses contempt for God, either directly or through His saints and holy things. Blasphemy is a grievous sin. It can become venial only through lack of reflection or consent.

- Blasphemy is heretical when it contains a denial of faith, for example, a denial of God's existence, His mercy, providence, or justice.

> `"And thou shalt speak to the children of Israel: The man that curseth his God, shall bear his sin: And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, dying let him die. All the multitude shall stone him, whether he be a native or a stranger. He that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, dying let him die" (Leviticus 24:15-16).`

> `"'Amen I say to you, that all sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men, and the blasphemies wherewith they may blaspheme; but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but will be guilty of an everlasting sin.' For they said, 'He has an unclean spirit' " (Mark 3:28-30).`

### Q. 234. What is the third commandment of God?

**A.** The third commandment of God is: Remember thou keep holy the Lord's Day.

- The obligation to worship God is imposed on all men by the natural law. Man is obliged to adore and to thank God for His continuous blessings. Since the nature of man makes it impossible for him actually to express his adoration and his thanks continuously, reason dictates that certain times be specified for this purpose. God defined more exactly how man is to fulfill this obligation by His divine precept given in the Old Testament.

> `"And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made: and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done. And he blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made" (Genesis 2:2-3).`

> `"Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day. Six days shalt thou labor, and shalt do all thy works. But on the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: thou shalt do no work on it, thou nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy beast, nor the stranger that is within thy gates. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all things that are in them, and rested on the seventh day: therefore the Lord blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it" (Exodus 20:8-11).`

> `"Observe the day of the Sabbath, to sanctify it, as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee. Six days shalt thou labor, and shalt do all thy works. The seventh is the day of the sabbath, that is, the rest of the Lord thy God" (Deuteronomy 5:12-14).`

### Q. 235. Why does the Church command us to keep Sunday as the Lord's Day?

**A.** The Church commands us to keep Sunday as the Lord's Day, because on Sunday Christ rose from the dead, and on Sunday the Holy Ghost descended upon the apostles.

- The early Church changed the day of worship from Saturday to Sunday on the authority given to it by Christ. The New Testament makes no explicit mention that the apostles changed the day of worship, but we know it from Tradition.

### Q. 236. What are we commanded by the third commandment?

**A.** By the third commandment we are commanded to worship God in a special manner on Sunday, the Lord's Day.

> `"Keep you my Sabbath: for it is holy unto you. He that shall profane it, shall be put to death: he that shall do any work in it, his soul shall perish out of the midst of his people. Six days shall you do work: in the seventh day is the Sabbath, the rest holy to the Lord" (Exodus 31:14-15).`

### Q. 237. How does the Church command us to worship God on Sunday?

**A.** The Church commands us to worship God on Sunday by assisting at the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass.

- Catholics who have reached the age of seven years and have sufficient use of reason are bound under pain of mortal sin to hear Mass on Sunday.
- To satisfy the obligation to assist at Mass on Sunday a person must actually be present at the place where Mass is celebrated. If he cannot enter the church because it is overcrowded, he can still hear Mass provided he is part of the assembly assisting at the Holy Sacrifice. A person who is a notable distance from the worshipers certainly is not bodily present at Mass
- A person should be present for the entire Mass, from the beginning to the last Gospel. It is a venial sin to miss even a slight part of a Mass of obligation deliberately and a mortal sin to miss a notable part. The obligation to assist at Mass is not fulfilled if the Consecration or the Communion is missed. The obligation can be fulfilled by hearing parts of two or more Masses in succession, provided one is present for both the Consecration and the Communion of the same Mass.
- To fulfill the obligation to assist at Mass a person must have at least an implicit intention of hearing Mass and must advert, at least in a vague way, to the celebration of the Mass. It would be a mortal sin if he paid no attention at all to the principal parts of the Mass at which he assisted on Sunday. A person is obliged under pain of venial sin to avoid deliberate distractions during Mass and to take ordinary care to assist attentively and in a becoming manner.
- The Mass offers us an opportunity to gain great spiritual benefits, and the more frequently and more devoutly we hear Mass, the more grace we can obtain. Ordinarily the best way to hear Mass is to unite with the priest and follow him in reciting the prayers of the Mass.
- A grave inconvenience to oneself or to another excuses one from the obligation to hear Mass on Sundays and holydays.

### Q. 238. What is forbidden by the third commandment of God?

**A.** By the third commandment of God all unnecessary servile work on Sunday is forbidden.

### Q. 239. What is servile work?

**A.** Servile work is that which requires labor of body rather than of mind.

- Farming, mechanical and industrial labor, and business transactions are forbidden even though one does them for pleasure and without any gain. Reading, writing, typewriting, studying, drawing, painting, embroidering, playing music, traveling, hunting, fishing, and the like are not servile works even though they may require considerable bodily exertion.
- The obligation to avoid servile work on Sunday is grave, and therefore, its violation is a mortal sin if one works for a notable time.

### Q. 240. When is servile work allowed on Sunday?

**A.** Servile work is allowed on Sunday when the honor of God, our own need, or that of our neighbor requires it.

- It is permissible on Sunday to do work directly concerned with divine worship; to perform necessary household duties which cannot conveniently be anticipated or deferred; to take personal care of the sick; and to do work required for the common good or necessary for one's own livelihood.

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT THE 2nd AND 3rd COMMANDMENTS

- Like the first commandment, the second and third commandments of God are concerned with man's duties toward his Creator. The second regards his duties in the matter of speech, the third in the matter of external worship.
    
- It is indeed sad to realize that many persons use one of God's greatest gifts, the gift of speech, to insult God Himself. Nowadays, the use of the name of God and of the holy name of Jesus as an interjection to mark any form of feeling or emotion has become common. Even children, barely able to speak, are thus using God's name in vain-often because they have heard it from their parents. Cursing and even blasphemy are also frequent. In the courtroom perjury is something often committed with little or no qualm of conscience. Truly, the world today has forgotten the commandment: "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain".
    
- Catholics should set an example of reverence toward the holy name of God and of His Incarnate Son. To incite Catholic men toward such reverence and to wage warfare on all evil talk, the Holy Name Society has been organized for Catholic men, and branches are established in almost every parish. It is a commendable practice of Catholics to bow reverently whenever they use or hear the name of Jesus.
    
- A vow is an act of religion most pleasing to God. It is a deliberate promise made to God whereby a person binds himself under pain of sin to do something that is especially pleasing to God. The most common vows in the Catholic Church are the public vows of poverty, chastity and obedience taken by members of religious orders and religious congregations. By the vow of poverty, a religious promises to live frugally and not to use money or other material goods except in accordance with the rules of his or her order and with proper permission; by the vow of chastity, he or she promises not to marry or in any way violate the sixth or the ninth commandment; by the vow of obedience he or she promises to obey the Pope and the lawful superiors of his or her order.
    
- The third commandment, as God gave it to the Jewish people, designated the seventh day of the week, the Sabbath, as the special day of worship of the Most High. God Himself laid down detailed rules as to the manner in which the Jews were to observe this day. Under the Christian law the first day of the week, Sunday, is the day set aside for the special worship of
    
- God. The Church does not impose the many restrictions that were prescribed for the Sabbath among the ancient Jews; but all Catholics are obliged to attend Mass and to abstain from servile work. It makes no difference whether the work is performed for wages or not. On the other hand, the Church does not forbid lawful amusement, such as athletics, nor work that is of a literary, artistic, or intellectual nature. Sometimes it is not easy to distinguish between prohibited work and lawful occupation. Thus, to paint a house is servile work, to paint a picture is liberal. In doubt, Catholics should consult their confessor before commencing the work.
    
- Finally we should remember that while the Church obliges us to no other religious service on Sunday but Mass, it is advisable to devote more time to the worship of God, particularly by attendance at Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament. Sunday is also an appropriate day for reading some good Catholic literature, especially the diocesan Catholic paper, and for tuning in on Catholic radio programs.
    

### RESOLUTION

- Resolve to bow reverently every time you hear or pronounce the Holy Name of Jesus; and if you hear this Holy Name taken irreverently, say in your heart: "Blessed be the name of Jesus".

#### B. PROBLEMS AND EXERCISES

*(Answer the questions orally or write them as your teacher may direct):*

- When our gift of speech treats of things divine, what commandment governs its use?
- Which of the commandments regulates our external worship?
- Which vows are most commonly made by Catholics? Explain them.
- Hugo is a member of the parish Holy Name Society. He tries to induce Julian to become a member. Julian in the meantime asks you what the real purpose of the Holy Name Society is. Tell him.
- Julian has been, for many years, an extremely profane fellow. He wants to know if the Holy Name Society will be satisfied if he reveres the Holy Name, or must he also give up his profanity. Answer him.
- What practice is recommended to you when you use the Holy Name, or hear others use It?
- In certain Catholic countries many boys receive in Baptism the name of Jesus. Does this lesson suggest to you a reason why it is not customary in the United States to confer this Holy Name in Baptism?

- Father Elias, giving a children's mission, suggests to them that if they offend God by irreverent and profane speech they should make the sign of the cross over their lips, and say an ejaculation. Would you agree that this is a good practice? Why?
- On Sunday morning after Mass, Cornelius was prevented from overhauling his motor boat by the reminder of his mother that he should not do servile work on Sunday. That afternoon he pitched a fifteen-inning ballgame. At supper, he tells his mother that he is more tired out than he would have been had he worked the whole day on his motorboat. Why was he allowed to play baseball, and forbidden to work on his motorboat?

## Lesson 19: The Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Commandments of God `(Điều Răn thứ Tư, thứ Năm, và thứ Sáu của Thiên Chúa)`

### Q. 241. What is the fourth commandment of God?

**A.** The fourth commandment of God is: Honor thy father and thy mother.

- This commandment deals explicitly with the duties of children toward their parents, implicitly with the obligation of parents toward their children. Parents should make themselves worthy of the honor which this commandment imposes.
- All true authority of superiors comes from God. Subjects must therefore respect their legitimate superiors and obey their just commands. Superiors in turn must exercise their authority in full conformity with the laws of nature and of God.

> `"Honor thy father and thy mother, that thou mayest be long-lived upon the land which the Lord thy God will give thee" (Exodus 20:12).`

### Q. 242. What are we commanded by the fourth commandment?

**A.** By the fourth commandment we are commanded to respect and love our parents, to obey them in all that is not sinful, and to help them when they are in need.

- Children respect their parents when they pay them due reverence, speak and act with proper deference, accept their corrections readily, seek their advice regarding important decisions, and bear with charity their parents' faults.
- Children love their parents when they wish them well, show them a spirit of gratitude, try to please and help them, and pray for them.
- Children should obey the lawful commands of their parents as long as they live under parental authority. Parents must not command their children to sin. Children must obey the laws of God rather than the commands of men-even of their parents, when such commands are against the law of God.
- Children should ordinarily consult their parents about the choice of a state of life, but they are not strictly obliged to follow their advice.
- Parents must not command a son or a daughter to marry. One may exercise one's natural right to live singly if one so desires; moreover, the state of virginity or celibacy, embraced for the love of God, is higher than the married state. Parents must not command their children to marry a certain person. Ordinarily children should consult their parents before definitely deciding to marry. They are not always obliged to follow their parents' advice.
- Children are obliged to aid their parents in bodily or spiritual need, when they can do so. Children must provide for parents who are not able to support themselves.

***The Holy Family***

- *At the top, the Child Jesus is helping the Blessed Virgin Mary in her housework and St. Joseph in his craft.*
- *At the bottom left, in the presence of the angel Raphael, the young is restoring the sight of his father by anointing his eyes with the fish gall that he brought back from his journey.*
- *On the right, Our Savior is assisting St. Joseph, his foster-father, in his last moments, pressing him affectionately against His Sacred Heart.*

***Our Lord and the Centurion***

- *This picture offers two touching examples of the duties of masters towards their servants. The first is that of the centurion of the Gospel:*

> "Now when He had entered Capharnaum, there came to Him a centurion who entreated Him, saying, 'Lord, my servant is lying sick in the house, paralyzed, and is grievously afflicted.' Jesus said to him, 'I will come and cure him.' But in answer the centurion said, 'Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof; but only say the word, and my servant shall be healed. For I too am a man subject to authority, and have soldiers subject to me; and I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.' And when Jesus heard this, He marveled, and said to those who were following Him, 'Amen I say to you, I have not found such great faith in Israel. And I tell you that many will come from the east and from the west, and will feast with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, but the children of the kingdom will be put forth into the darkness outside; there will be the weeping, and the gnashing of teeth.' Then Jesus said to the centurion, 'Go thy way; as thou hast believed, so be it done to thee.' And the servant was healed in that hour." (Matthew 8:5-13)

- *At the top, this centurion is shown on his knees at the feet of Jesus, who is surrounded by His apostles. Two servants who accompanied him stand respectfully behind their master.*
- *The second example, shown at the bottom left, is that of St. Elzear, count of Sabran, in Provence. Having drawn up a rule of life for his servants, St. Elzear has it displayed in one of the most beautiful rooms of his palace, and gathers his servants there to explain it to them. Here are the chief provisions:*
- *Morning and evening prayers. Assistance at the Holy Mass. Frequent reception of the sacraments. Devotion to the Holy Virgin and to St. Joseph. To avoid idleness. To flee bad company. To avoid quarrels, etc.*
- *St. Elzear is standing at a chair, facing his servants to whom he is showing the rule. A crucifix and a statue of the Holy Virgin adorn the room. St. Delphine, his wife, helps with the instructions and forms, with her servants and daughters of honor, the little group to the right of her husband.*
- *We are obliged: (1) to respect our superiors, (2) to serve them with fidelity, (3) to obey them in all that is not contrary to the law of God. We must regard our superiors as the representatives of God and obey them as God Himself.*
- *At the bottom right, Eliezer, the servant of Abraham, offers to us a remarkable example of the fidelity that we owe to our superiors. He embarks on a long journey and goes to Mesopotamia to look for a wife for Isaac, his young master. Laden with gifts, he is near a well with his camels. Rebecca, daughter of Nachor, brother of Abraham, is there with a few companions to draw water. She presents some to Eliezer, who, recognizing in this a sign of the will of the Lord, offers her in exchange the lavish gifts from his master.*

> `"He that honoreth his mother is as one that layeth up a treasure. He that honoreth his father shall have joy in his own children: and in the day of his prayer he shall be heard. He that honoreth his father shall enjoy a long life: and he that obeyeth the father shall be comfort to his mother. He that feareth the Lord honoreth his parents and will serve them as his masters that brought him into the world. Honor thy father, in work and word, and all patience: That a blessing may come upon thee from him, and his blessing may remain in the latter end" (Ecclesiasticus 3:5-10).`

> `"Support the old age of thy father: and grieve him not in his life; and if his understanding fail, have patience with him, and despise him not when thou art in thy strength: for the relieving of the father shall not be forgotten." (Ecclesiasticus 3:14-15).`

> `"Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for that is right. 'Honor thy father and thy mother'- such is the first commandment with a promise - 'that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest be long-lived upon the earth' " (Ephesians 6:1-3).`

### Q. 243. Does the fourth commandment oblige us to respect and to obey others besides our parents?

**A.** Besides our parents, the fourth commandment obliges us to respect and to obey all our lawful superiors.

- All are obliged to respect and to obey legitimate civil and ecclesiastical authorities when they discharge lawfully their official duties. Children must obey their teachers and other persons in whose charge they have been placed by their parents.

> `"And he said to them, 'Render, therefore, to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's' " (Luke 20:25).`

> `"Let everyone be subject to the higher authorities, for there exists no authority except from God, and those who exist have been appointed by God. Therefore he who resists the authority resists the ordinance of God; and they that resist bring on themselves condemnation. For rulers are a terror not to the good work but to the evil. Dost thou wish, then, not to fear the authority? Do what is good and thou wilt have praise from it. For it is God's minister to thee for good. But if thou dost what is evil, fear, for not without reason does it carry the sword. For it is God's minister, an avenger to execute wrath on him who does evil. Wherefore you must needs be subject, not only because of the wrath, but also for conscience' sake. For this is also why you pay tribute, for they are the ministers of God, serving unto this very end. Render to all men whatever is their due; tribute to whom tribute is due; taxes to whom taxes are due; fear to whom fear is due; honor to whom honor is due" (Romans 13:1-7).`

### Q. 244. What duty have parents toward their children and superiors toward those under their care?

**A.** Parents must provide for the spiritual and bodily welfare of their children; superiors, according to their varying degrees of responsibility, must care for those entrusted to them.

- Parents must manifest their love for their children in a reasonable manner. They must be on guard lest they spoil their children by granting them unreasonable requests; they must not neglect to correct their faults.
- It is the duty of parents to care for the spiritual welfare of their children, by having them baptized as soon as possible, by having them well instructed in the truths of religion; by training them in the practice of the Christian virtues, both by word and example; by counseling them to choose good companions; by directing their reading and recreation; and by urging them to fulfill their obligations to assist at Mass on Sundays and holydays, and to receive the sacraments regularly, even frequently.
- The Church forbids parents to send their children to non-Catholic or secular schools in which the Catholic religion is not taught, unless the bishop of a diocese grants permission because of particular circumstances.
- Parents are responsible for the physical and social well-being of their children. They must provide the necessary food, clothing, shelter, and medical care insofar as they are able. Parents are equally responsible for the intellectual and religious instruction and moral training of their children. They should rear them to be useful, self-supporting, patriotic citizens and informed, practical members of the Church.

> `"He that spareth the rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him correcteth him betimes" (Proverbs 13:24).`

> `"Hast thou children? Instruct them, and bow down their neck from their childhood" (Ecclesiasticus 7:25).`

> `"And you, fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but rear them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord" (Ephesians 6:4).`

### Q. 245. What are the duties of a citizen toward his country?

**A.** A citizen must love his country, be sincerely interested in its welfare, and respect and obey its lawful authority.

- A person who plots against his country or rebels against its legitimate government commits a grave sin. Citizens, however, have a right to defend themselves against tyranny when there is no other way to secure the exercise of their fundamental human rights.

> *`See Scripture, question 243, Romans 13:1-7.`*

### Q. 246. How does a citizen show a sincere interest in his country's welfare?

**A.** A citizen shows a sincere interest in his country's welfare by voting honestly and without selfish motives, by paying just taxes, and by defending his country's rights when necessary.

- Citizens should exercise their right to vote. This is a moral obligation when the common good of the state or the good of religion, especially in serious matters, can be promoted.
- Citizens should vote for the candidates who in their judgment are best qualified to discharge the duties of public office. Mere personal gain or friendship does not justify one's voting for a candidate. It would be sinful to cast a ballot for one who, in the judgment of the voters, would do grave public harm.
- Citizens of a country as well as aliens should obey the law of paying just taxes in order to contribute their fair share to the lawful expenses of good government and public security.
- Citizens are obliged to help their country wage a just war. They must serve in the armed forces if the government commands them to do so unless they are convinced from adequate and unquestionable evidence that the war is unjust.

### Q. 247. Why must we respect and obey the lawful authority of our country?

**A.** We must respect and obey the lawful authority of our country because it comes from God, the Source of all authority.

- Citizens may accept any form of government that does not claim for itself rights that belong to God alone or those that are proper to the individual, to the family, or to the Church. The state exists for the common good of men, and not men for the state. A government may not infringe on the right of an individual or of a family to worship God and to live according to His laws; nor may it forbid parents to instruct their children in the truths of God and to train them in virtuous living. A government may not prohibit the Church from preaching the Gospel, administering the sacraments, and legislating in all those matters that pertain to the worship of God and the salvation of souls.
- If a government commands citizens to violate the law of God they must refuse to obey, for, according to Saint Luke, "We must obey God rather than men" (Acts 5:29).

> *`See Scripture, question 243.`*

### Q. 248. Why are we obliged to take an active part in works of good citizenship?

**A.** We are obliged to take an active part in works of good citizenship because right reason requires citizens to work together for the public welfare of the country.

### Q. 249. What are the chief duties of those who hold public office?

**A.** The chief duties of those who hold public office are to be just to all in exercising their authority and to promote the general welfare.

> `"Give ear, you that rule the people, and that please yourselves in multitudes of nations: For power is given you by the Lord, and strength by the most High. Who will examine your works, and search out your thoughts" (Wisdom 6:3-4).`

### Q. 250. What does the fourth commandment forbid?

**A.** The fourth commandment forbids disrespect, unkindness, and disobedience to our parents and lawful superiors.

- Children sin mortally when they fail to give the respect and love due to their parents by hating them, unjustly threatening them, or striking them, by seriously insulting or ridiculing them, by wishing them serious evil, by treating them heartlessly, by disregarding them when they are in grave need, by cursing them, by causing them great sorrow, or by provoking them to serious anger.
- Children still subject to parental authority sin mortally by disobeying the just commands of their parents in serious matters. The command of parents to avoid bad companions, sinful reading or immoral amusements, to receive the sacraments and religious instruction, to assist according to the law of the Church at Mass on Sundays and holydays of obligation, and to preserve the necessary order and peace of the home, must be considered as ordinarily binding under serious obligation. The disobedience of young children is frequently not sinful because of inadvertence, levity, or lack of seriousness on the part of parents who do not insist on their children obeying their commands under pain of sin.
- Disobedience of children and of other subjects, even in slight matters, can become a grave sin when the motive of the disobedience is serious contempt for the authority of parents and legitimate superiors.

> `"Cursed be he that honoreth not his father and mother. And all the people shall say: Amen" (Deuteronomy 27:16).`

> `"Render to all men whatever is their due; tribute to whom tribute is due; taxes to whom taxes are due; fear to whom fear is due; honor to whom honor is due" (Romans 13:7).`

### Q. 251. What is the fifth commandment of God?

**A.** The fifth commandment of God is: Thou shalt not kill.

- Killing, which is forbidden by this commandment, means taking the life of a human being unjustly. Animals may be killed for man's reasonable need or convenience. Hunting, fishing, and using animals for scientific purposes are permissible. To kill or injure animals without a good reason is sinful but it is not a violation of this commandment.

> `"Thou shalt not kill" (Exodus 20:13).`

### Q. 252. What are we commanded by the fifth commandment?

**A.** By the fifth commandment we are commanded to take proper care of our own spiritual and bodily well-being and that of our neighbor.

- Man does not have supreme dominion over his own life; he was not the cause of its beginning nor may he be the deliberate cause of its end. Man must use the ordinary means to preserve life. He is not, however, obliged to use extraordinary means which would involve relatively great expense or intolerable pain or shame.
- Man is obliged to use prudent means in order to preserve his health and the health of those under his care.

### Q. 253. What does the fifth commandment forbid?

**A.** The fifth commandment forbids murder and suicide, and also fighting, anger, hatred, revenge, drunkenness, and bad example.

- Murder is the voluntary and unjust killing of a human being. It is a serious crime because it is an infringement on the right of God's dominion over human life and is an irreparable injustice to the victim, to his family, and to society.
- The life of another person may lawfully be taken: first, in order to protect one's own life or that of a neighbor, or a serious amount of possessions from an unjust aggressor, provided no other means of protection is effective; second, by a soldier fighting a just war; third, by a duly appointed executioner of the state when he metes out a just punishment for a crime.
- War is an armed conflict between sovereign states which is undertaken by public sanction. A nation may wage a just war under the following conditions: first, if it is necessary to defend the rights of the state in a grave matter, second, if it is undertaken only as a last resort after all other means have failed; third, if it is conducted justly in accordance with natural and international law; fourth, if it is not continued after due satisfaction has been offered or given by the unjust aggressor nation.
- The direct intention to kill an innocent person is never permissible, either by public or private authority. The state does not have the right to take the life of a sick person, even at his own request, in order to relieve him of pain. An unborn child has the same right to life as any other person and may never be directly killed, even to save the life of the mother.
- The human body may not be mutilated unless there is no other way to preserve the health or to save the life of a person.
- It is sinful to risk one's life without a sufficiently good reason. To risk one's life in order to save the life of another person is permissible and in certain cases obligatory. It is the law of the Church that the bodies of those who have knowingly and deliberately committed suicide shall not be given Christian burial.
- One may never take part in a duel, which is a prearranged contest between two persons with deadly weapons. The Church punishes with excommunication not only those who engage in a duel, but also those who assist them and even those who are deliberately present at a duel and do not, as far as they can, try to prevent it. Unjust anger leads to hatred, revenge, fighting, and other grave sins.
- Excessive eating and drinking are sinful because they injure the health of a person and often lead to other sins. A person commits a mortal sin when by excessive use of alcoholic drink he deliberately deprives himself of the use of reason without a just cause, or when by habitual drinking he seriously injures his health, neglects to provide for his family or gives scandal, or when, as a result of excessive drinking, he violates a grave obligation arising from the law of God, the Church, or the state.

***The Martyrdom of St. Stephen***

- *The top picture shows St. Stephen, deacon and first martyr, giving the admirable example of the pardon of his enemies. Kneeling with his eyes lifted up to heaven, he addresses to God his touching prayer for the Jews who are stoning him:*

> "Lord, do not lay this sin against them." (Acts 7:60)

- *Suddenly, Heaven opens before him. God looks at him with pleasure with His arms extended towards him. An angel offers him the palm of martyrdom, and another shows him the crown that awaits him.*
- *At the bottom of this plate on the left are Esau and Jacob being reconciled to each other, while on the right, St. Cyprian is about to be beheaded. His friends are paying the executioner twenty-five gold pieces, having been ordered to do so by the Saint. St. Cyprian was a bishop, and he shares the feast day of September 16 with St. Cornelius, Pope and Martyr. The two martyrs are mentioned together in the Canon of the Mass.*
- *All the scenes of this plate relate to the commandment, "Thou shalt not kill."*

> `"You have heard that it was said to the ancients, 'Thou shalt not kill; and that whoever shall kill shall be liable to judgment. But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to judgment; and whoever says to his brother, 'Raca,' shall be liable to the Sanhedrin; and whoever says, 'Thou fool!' shall be liable to the fire of Gehenna. Therefore, if thou art offering thy gift at the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother has anything against thee, leave thy gift before the altar and go first to be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift" (Matthew 5:21-24).`

> `"Woe to the world because of scandals! For it must be that scandals come, but woe to the man through whom scandal does come! And if thy hand or thy foot is an occasion of sin to thee, cut it off and cast it from thee! It is better for thee to enter life maimed or lame, than, having two hands or two feet, to be cast into the everlasting fire. And if thy eye is an occasion of sin to thee, pluck it out and cast it from thee! It is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, than, having two eyes, to be cast into hell-fire" (Matthew 18:7-9).`

> `"The works of the flesh are manifest, which are ... enmities, contention ... anger, quarrels ... murders, drunkenness, carousings, and suchlike. And concerning these I warn you, as I have warned you, that they who do such things will not attain the kingdom of God" (Galatians 5:19-21).`

> `"But let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to wrath. For the wrath of man does not work the justice of God" (James 1:19-20).`

> `"Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer. And you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him" (1 John 3:15).`

### Q. 254. What is the sixth commandment of God?

**A.** The sixth commandment of God is: Thou shalt not commit adultery.

> `"Thou shalt not commit adultery" (Exodus 20:14).`

### Q. 255. What are we commanded by the sixth commandment?

**A.** By the sixth commandment we are commanded to be pure and modest in our behavior.

- Purity is a moral virtue which rightly regulates all voluntary expression of sexual pleasure in marriage and excludes it altogether outside the married state. Purity, moreover, is necessary to preserve and to strengthen the other virtues.
- Modesty inclines one to refrain from any action or word that might lead oneself or others to an unlawful incitement of the sexual appetite. Modesty is necessary for safeguarding purity.

> `"I exhort you therefore, brethren, by the mercy of God, to present your bodies as a sacrifice, living, holy, pleasing to God-your spiritual service" (Romans 12:1).`

> `"Or do you not know that your members are the temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own? For you have been bought at a great price. Glorify God and bear him in your body" (1 Corinthians 6:19-20).`

### Q. 256. What does the sixth commandment forbid?

**A.** The Sixth commandment forbids all impurity and immodesty in words, looks, and actions, whether alone or with others.

- Impurity is any deliberate thought, word, look, or deed with one self or another by which the sexual appetite is aroused outside of marriage, and even in marriage when contrary to the purpose for which God instituted the married state.
- Some of the chief sins against purity are: first, adultery, by which one violates the sexual rights of the married state. This sin is also committed by one who lives as the legal husband or wife of another after one or both parties have secured a civil divorce; second, fornication, by which an unmarried person usurps the marriage right by sexual intercourse with another unmarried person; third, deliberate actions with oneself or others performed to arouse the sexual appetite.
- Immodesty is any deliberate thought, word, or action that tends toward impurity.
- When there is full deliberation in any sin of impurity it is a mortal sin. Immodesty may be either a mortal or venial sin depending on the greater or less danger of impurity to which it tends, the degree of scandal, and the intention of the sinner.
- Sins of impurity and immodesty are extremely dangerous because human nature is strongly inclined toward them and because they quickly develop into habits that are most difficult to eradicate.

***Our Lord and Mary Magdalene***

- *At the top is Our Lord and, at His feet, a woman who was guilty of the sin of adultery. We read in the Gospel:*

> "Now the Scribes and Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery, and setting her in the midst, said to Him, 'Master, this woman has just now been caught in adultery. And in the Law Moses commanded us to stone such persons. What, therefore, dost thou say?' Now they were saying this to test Him, in order that they might be able to accuse him. But Jesus, stooping down, began to write with His finger on the ground.  
> "But when they continued asking him, he raised Himself and said to them, 'Let him who is without sin among you be the first to cast a stone at her.' And again stooping down, he began to write on the ground. But hearing this, they went away, one by one, beginning with the eldest. And Jesus remained alone, with the woman standing in the midst.  
> "And Jesus, raising Himself, said to her, 'Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned thee?' She said, 'No one, Lord.' Then Jesus said, 'Neither will I condemn thee. Go thy way, and from now on sin no more.' " (John 8:3-11)

- *At the bottom right is King David, and before him the prophet Nathan. He is reproaching David for the adultery which he committed with Bethsabee and for the murder of her husband Urias.*
- *On the left is shown the story which Nathan told to make David realize the enormity of his crime:*

> "There were," he told him, "two men in one city, the one rich and the other poor. The rich man had exceeding many sheep and oxen. But the poor man had nothing at all but one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up, and which had grown up in his house together with his children, eating of his bread, and drinking of his cup, and sleeping in his bosom: and it was unto him as a daughter. And when a certain stranger was come to the rich man, he spared to take of his own sheep and oxen, to make a feast for that stranger, who was come to him: but took the poor man's ewe, and dressed it for the man that was come to him. And David's anger being exceedingly kindled against that man, he said to Nathan, 'As the Lord liveth, the man that hath done this is a child of death.' "  
> "Thou art the man," replied the prophet. "Thus saith the Lord, 'I anointed thee king over Israel; and I delivered thee from the hand of Saul, and gave thee thy master's house and all his goods, and I was to add far greater things to thee. Why therefore hast thou despised the word of the Lord, to commit sin by causing Urias the Hethite to perish by the sword and by marrying his wife? In punishment for thy double crime, it is from thy own family that the Lord will raise up ministers of His vengeance. Thy family will become for thee a source of unhappiness.'  
> "The king was astounded, and was seized with repentance in the depths of his soul and uttered this saving cry of penitence that God will never despise, 'I have sinned against the Lord.' " ()

> `"You have heard that it was said to the ancients, 'Thou shalt not commit adultery.' But I say to you that anyone who so much as looks with lust at a woman has already committed adultery with her in his heart" (Matthew 5:27-28).`

> `"But immorality and every uncleanness or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as becomes saints; or obscenity or foolish talk or scurrility, which are out of place; but rather thanksgiving. For now this and understand, that no fornicator, or unclean person, or covetous one (for that is idolatry) has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. Let no one lead you astray with empty words; for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the children of disobedience" (Ephesians 5:3-7).`

> `"For this is the will of God, your sanctification; that you abstain from immorality; that every one of you learn how to possess his vessel in holiness and honor, not in the passion of lust like the Gentiles who do not know God" (1 Thessalonians 4:3-5).`

### Q. 257. What are the chief dangers to the virtue of chastity?

**A.** The chief dangers to the virtue of chastity are: idleness, sinful curiosity, bad companions, drinking, immodest dress, and indecent books, plays, and motion pictures.

- We must avoid as far as possible any person, place, or thing that is likely to tempt us to immodesty and impurity. Special care must be taken to avoid the near occasions of these sins.
- Unmarried persons may not carry on a courtship with those who are not free to marry. They should avoid receiving any attention from them. Familiarity with such persons can readily lead to many sins of impurity and to an invalid marriage.

> `"Idleness hath taught much evil" (Ecclesiasticus 33:29).`

### Q. 258. What are the chief means of preserving the virtue of chastity?

**A.** The chief means of preserving the virtue of chastity are to avoid carefully all unnecessary dangers, to seek God's help through prayer, frequent confession, Holy Communion, and assistance at Holy Mass, and to have a special devotion to the Blessed Virgin.

> `"Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak" (Mark 14:38).`

> `"Be sober, be watchful! For your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goes about seeking someone to devour. Resist him, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same suffering befalls your brethren all over the world" (1 Peter 5:8-9).`

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT THE 4th, 5th and 6th COMMANDMENTS

- After the first three commandments prescribing man's duties toward God come seven others laying down man's obligations toward himself and his fellow-men. There is first a special commandment regarding the important duties of children toward their parents, and of parents toward their children. This is the fourth of the Ten Commandments. In a general way, the others are concerned with actions (5, 6, 7), and words (8), and desires (9, 10).
    
- It is important to remember that the commandments imply much more than they expressly command. For example, the fourth commandment explicitly prescribes only honor for one's parents, but under this heading are included love, obedience and service. Moreover, as the Church interprets it, this same commandment refers to the duties of all those in any position of subordination toward lawful superiors; it also imposes on those who rule others, particularly parents, the obligation to provide for the welfare of those in their charge. Similarly, the fifth commandment, though it explicitly forbids only killing, is to be extended to the prohibition of any unjust injury to the body, and even to the soul, whether of oneself or of other human beings. The sixth commandment is explicitly directed against adultery-the gravest sin of impurity that can be committed by or against a married person. Yet, it really forbids every external act against the noble virtues of chastity and modesty.
    
- Many persons in public office seem to forget that they are strictly bound to provide for the welfare of the citizens and to protect their rights; they are guilty of sin if they neglect to perform the duties demanded of them or if they exercise their authority for their own personal advantage rather than for the benefit of their fellow citizens. A public official must always remember that the authority he possesses comes to him from God and that he must employ that authority in the way that God wills. It is unfortunate that there are many public officials nowadays who, while they may be conscientious in their duties as private citizens and perhaps even faithful in their religious practices, frequently transgress the fourth commandment in their public life.
    
- It should be our concern to regard the commandments of God, not as merely forbidding what is bad but also as commanding what is good. Of the commandments considered in this lesson, the one which demands the most effort for its observance and entails the most exalted holiness on the part of those who obey it perfectly is the sixth commandment. Nowadays there is much in the world that incites people to sins of impurity. We must be constantly on our guard lest we fall into this degrading sin. To mention only a few of the sources of danger to chastity in our own land, there are obscene motion pictures, magazines filled with lewd pictures, a great laxity in the matter of dress. Catholics should be mindful of the admonitions of recent Popes regarding these dangers. If Catholics follow those admonitions of the Church, and make use of the means at their disposal to gain spiritual strength-particularly the frequent reception of Holy Communion, nourishing us with the immaculate flesh of Our Divine Saviour-they can avoid the dangers that surround them and practice perfectly the virtue of purity, known as the angelic virtue, because it makes us like the pure angels who surround the throne of God in heaven.
    

### RESOLUTION

- Resolve that you will carefully avoid anything that may endanger your purity, such as bad companions, dangerous reading, unchaste conversation and suggestive motion pictures.

## Lesson 20: The Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Commandments of God `(Điều Răn thứ Bảy, thứ Tám, thứ Chín, và thứ Mười của Thiên Chúa)`

### Q. 259. What is the seventh commandment of God?

**A.** The seventh commandment of God is: Thou shalt not steal.

- To steal is to take or to retain voluntarily something belonging to another, for gain, against his reasonable will. To steal secretly is theft; to steal violently is robbery.
- Theft and robbery are contrary to the natural law and are opposed to justice. They are considered mortal sins unless that which is stolen is of little value. Even in the case of slight value, the violence attached to robbery may make it a mortal sm.
- When the thing stolen is of great value, solely from its own intrinsic worth, it is said to constitute absolutely grave matter. Theft or robbery of something which in itself is grave matter may not impose a hardship on the owner but it is a mortal sin because it is a serious attack on society, on the public peace of a community, and on its security. Dishonesty which seriously disturbs the public order is always a mortal sin. The amount that constitutes absolutely grave matter in theft or robbery varies in different countries, owing to the special conditions and circumstances of the countries.
- When the thing stolen is of relatively greater value, that is, not from its own intrinsic worth, but considering the condition of the owner and the injury suffered, it is said to constitute relatively grave matter. The theft, for example, from a poor man of an amount that is required for one day's support of himself and his family would constitute, at least, relatively grave matter and would be a mortal sin.
- One who frequently steals things of small value from one or different persons within a short period (a month of two), the total of which is of serious value, commits a mortal sin in the last act of the series of stealing, because the small amounts stolen go together to constitute grave matter.

> `"Thou shalt not steal" (Exodus 20:15).`

### Q. 260. What are we commanded by the seventh commandment?

**A.** By the seventh commandment we are commanded to respect what belongs to others, to live up to our business agreements, and to pay our just debts.

- These obligations are imposed on us in the court of conscience even though the civil law may not oblige us. It is sinful to incur willfully debts beyond one's ability to pay. The desire for pleasure and social and political ambition do not justify living beyond one's means, an abuse which has become a prevalent vice.

> `"The beginning of a good way is to do justice; and this is more acceptable with God than to offer sacrifices ... Better is a little with justice, than great revenues with iniquity" (Proverbs 16:5, 8).`

> `"The wicked man borrows and does not repay" (Psalm 36:21).`

> `"Render to all men whatever is their due; tribute to whom tribute is due; taxes to whom taxes are due ... " (Romans 13:7).`

### Q. 261. What does the seventh commandment forbid?

**A.** Besides stealing, the seventh commandment forbids cheating, unjust keeping of what belongs to others, unjust damage to the property of others, and the accepting of bribes by public officials.

- The seventh commandment is violated by merchants who use false weights and measures, make exorbitant profits, or lie about the essential qualities of their goods; by those who obtain money from others by persuading them to make unsound investments with the assurance of gain; and by those who knowingly pass counterfeit money or take undue advantage of the ignorance or necessity of another.
- Employers who defraud laborers by not paying them a just, living wage keep what belongs to others and are guilty of grave injustice not only to the employee but also to members of his family. This injustice can cause serious sins in the domestic life as well as in the social life of a community. Employees who waste time during working hours, do careless work, or neglect to take reasonable care of the property of their employers violate the seventh commandment.
- Public officials are obliged to make appointments on merit; they sin against the seventh commandment when they demand money or its equivalent for such appointments. If these appointees do not render a just service for the tax payments of a community, a further injustice is done to the citizens. Public officials sin mortally by taking bribes for allowing persons to violate the law in serious matters. The guilt of these officials is all the greater when they violate their oath to uphold the law.
- "Do not any unjust thing in judgment, in rule, in weight, or in measure. Let the balance be just and the weights equal, the bushel just, and the sextary equal" (Leviticus 19:35-36).

### Q. 262. Are we obliged to restore to the owner stolen goods, or their value?

**A.** We are obliged to restore to the owner stolen goods, or their value, whenever we are able.

- If the owner is dead, stolen goods must be restored to the heirs. If the owner or heir of stolen goods cannot be determined, the goods or their value are to be given to the poor or pious causes. A person who has obtained goods unjustly, but who no longer possesses them, must sincerely intend to make due restitution as soon as he can; otherwise his sin cannot be forgiven.
- A person who deliberately assists another in stealing, even though he receives none of the loot, must make restitution if the other person does not do so. Stolen goods that have been bought or received as a gift must be restored to their rightful owner. Compensation may be demanded from the person who stole the goods, but not from their owner. In some places, civil law makes provisions for the owner in such cases.
- Lost goods that are found may be kept only after every reasonable effort has been made to find the owner and to restore the goods.

> `"If any man steal an ox or a sheep, and kill or sell it: he shall restore five oxen for one ox, and four sheep for one sheep" (Exodus 22:1).`

### Q. 263. Are we obliged to repair damage unjustly done to the property of others?

**A.** We are obliged to repair damage unjustly done to the property of others, or to pay the amount of the damage, as; far as we are able.

- A person who has accidentally damaged the property of another through no fault of his own is not obliged to repair the damage unless required to do so by civil law.

> `"If any man hurt a field or a vineyard, and put in his beast to feed upon that which is other men's: he shall restore the best of whatsoever he hath in his own field, or in his vineyard, according to the estimation of the damage" (Exodus 22:5).`

### Q. 264. What is the eighth commandment of God?

**A.** The eighth commandment of God is: Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.

> `"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor" (Exodus 20:16).`

### Q. 265. What are we commanded by the eighth commandment?

**A.** By the eighth commandment we are commanded to speak the truth in all things, but especially in what concerns the good name and honor of others.

- This commandment concerns the practice of the virtue of truthfulness which promotes the general welfare of society, the orderly function of which depends, in large measure, on its members speaking the truth.
- A good name is a most precious possession. The eighth commandment obliges us to respect the good name of our neighbor by not making known his faults when we have no right to do so and by not making false accusations against him.

> `"Speak ye truth everyone to his neighbor" (Zacharias 8:16).`

> `"Wherefore, put away lying and speak truth each one with his neighbor, because we are members of one another" (Ephesians 4:25).`

### Q. 266. What does the eighth commandment forbid?

**A.** The eighth commandment forbids lies, rash judgment, detraction, calumny, and the telling of secrets we are bound to keep

- A lie expresses opposition between one's word and one's thought; it implies the intention to deceive by stating what is false. A lie is intrinsically wrong and is opposed to the natural law. It undermines mutual trust among men.
- Ordinarily, a lie told in jest or for someone's benefit is a venial sin; a deliberate lie which causes serious harm is a mortal sin. A lie told under oath is perjury and is always a mortal sin.
- It is permissible to give an evasive answer to a question when there is no obligation to answer. In this case, the hearer is permitted to deceive himself by his own interpretation.
- Cheating in examinations is wrong because one thereby acquires unearned credits in studies. If by cheating one wins a prize, one really steals and is obliged to restitution.

> `"Thou shalt fly lying" (Exodus 23:7).`

> `"Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord" (Proverbs 12:22).`

### Q. 267. When does a person commit the sin of rash judgment?

**A.** A person commits the sin of rash judgment when, without sufficient reason, he believes something harmful to another's character.

- We rightly prize the favorable judgment of others about our character. We may not, without certain knowledge, believe things that undermine or destroy the character of another. Rash judgment is a sin against justice; it is a mortal sin if grave injustice is done deliberately. To suspend judgment about a person's character until suspicion or doubt can be settled is not sinful.

> `"Before thou inquire, blame no man" (Ecclesiasticus 11:7).`

> `"Do not judge, that you may not be judged. For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged; and with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you. But why dost thou see the speck in thy brother's eye, and yet dost not consider the beam in thy own eye?" (Matthew 7:1-3).`

### Q. 268. When does a person commit the sin of detraction?

**A.** A person commits the sin of detraction when, without a good reason, he makes known the hidden faults of another.

- There must be a sufficiently grave reason to reveal the hidden faults of others, for example, the defense of one's self or others; the correction of others by their parents or superiors; the welfare of society, as when one is obliged to inform public authorities of another's secret crimes. A person who has been found guilty in court has lost his good name owing to the charge proved against him. It is not detraction to speak of this court action to others, nor is it against the eighth commandment to speak of faults that are generally known in a community. It is, however, more charitable not to do so.
- Detraction is a mortal sin if it unjustly does great harm to a person's reputation.
- We should avoid unkind remarks about others, and tale bearing which needlessly causes misunderstanding, distrust, and enmity.
- Contumely or insult dishonors a person unjustly in his presence by refusing to show him the signs of honor due him, or by not noticing him, or by making known his faults, without sufficient reason. The same harm can be done by any means of communication, as by letter, telephone, radio, motion picture, or television. Contumely is a sin against justice and charity and its gravity depends on the extent of the dishonor shown.

> `"The slanderer of his neighbor in secret: him I will destroy" (Psalm 100:5).`

> `"A good name is better than great riches: and good favor is above silver and gold" (Proverbs 22:1).`

> `"The whisperer and the double tongued is accursed: for he hath troubled many that were at peace" (Ecclesiasticus 28:15).`

> `"Take care of a good name: for this shall continue with thee, more than a thousand treasures precious and great" (Ecclesiasticus 41:15).`

> `"Admonish them ... speaking evil of none" (Titus 3:1-2).`

### Q. 269. When does a person commit the sin of calumny or slander?

**A.** A person commits the sin of calumny or slander when by lying he injures the good name of another.

- We are guilty of calumny or slander when we falsely charge another with defects or sins. Calumny is opposed to truth, justice, and charity. It is a mortal sin if serious harm is deliberately done.
- To listen with pleasure to calumny, slander, or detraction is a mortal sin against justice and against charity when prompted by hatred; it is a venial sin when the motive is curiosity or levity. We should try to change a conversation that seriously deals with calumny, slander, or detraction, or we should show that we are not interested in such conversation.

> `"Thou shalt not calumniate thy neighbor" (Leviticus 19:13).`

> `"Devise not a lie against thy brother: neither do the like against thy friend" (Ecclesiasticus 7:13).`

> `"Plunder no one, accuse no one falsely" (Luke 3:14).`

### Q. 270. When are we obliged to keep a secret?

**A.** We are obliged to keep a secret when we have promised to do so, when our office requires it, or when the good of another demands it.

- A person who violates a secret commits a mortal sin if he foresees that it will reasonably give greater offense or cause grave harm to another, or if the fact made known under secrecy is serious; otherwise it is a venial sin.
- It is permissible to reveal a secret if consent to do so can be reasonably presumed. A secret should be revealed to prevent some grave harm to the general welfare of a community or to an innocent party. Secrets of the confessional may never be revealed, no matter what the consequence, even if it be death.
- It is sinful to read a letter addressed to another without his permission, or to eavesdrop on private conversation, unless done in order to prevent some grave harm.

### Q. 271. What must a person do who has sinned by detraction or calumny, or has told a secret he is bound keep?

**A.** A person who has sinned by detraction or calumny, or who has told a secret he is bound to keep must repair the harm he has done to his neighbor, as far as he is able.

- This reparation, like the restoration of stolen goods, is necessary because a person's good name and honor are more precious than his material possessions. This obligation is serious when grave harm is done. It is binding even if the one who must retract thereby suffers some harm. If a person insults someone publicly, he is obliged to apologize publicly; if the insult is in private, the apology may be made privately.

### Q. 272. What is the ninth commandment of God?

**A.** The ninth commandment of God is: Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife.

> `"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife: nor his house" (Deuteronomy 5:21).`

### Q. 273. What are we commanded by the ninth commandment?

**A.** By the ninth commandment we are commanded to be pure in thought and desire.

> `"Evil thoughts are an abomination to the Lord: and pure words most beautiful shall be confirmed by him" (Proverbs 15:26).`

> `"Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see God" (Matthew 5:8).`

> `"For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, immorality, thefts, false witness, and blasphemies. These are the things that defile a man" (Matthew 15:19-20).`

> `"Therefore mortify your members, which are on earth: immorality, uncleanness, lust, evil desire and covetousness (which is a form of idol worship). Because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the unbelievers" (Colossians 3:5-6).`

> `"Beloved, I exhort you as strangers and pilgrims to abstain from carnal desires which war against the soul" (1 Peter 2:11).`

### Q. 274. Are mere thoughts about impure things always sinful in themselves?

**A.** Mere thoughts about impure things are not always sinful in themselves, but such thoughts are dangerous.

### Q. 275. When do thoughts about impure things become sinful?

**A.** Thoughts about impure things become sinful when a person thinks of an unchaste act and deliberately takes pleasure in so thinking, or when unchaste desire or passion is aroused and consent is given to it.

### Q. 276. What is forbidden by the ninth commandment?

**A.** The ninth commandment forbids all thoughts and desires contrary to chastity.

- We should form the habit of praying immediately when we are beset by impure thoughts, desires, or imaginations. It is well to know by heart many ejaculations addressed to Our Lord and His Blessed Mother which we should repeat in time of such temptations.
- In confessing deliberate impure desires, one must tell the confessor their object, for example, a married or single person, of the same or the opposite sex, because such circumstances change the nature of the sin.

### Q. 277. What is the tenth commandment of God?

**A.** The tenth commandment of God is: Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods.

> *`See Scripture, question 272, Deuteronomy 5:21.`*

### Q. 278. What does the tenth commandment forbid?

**A.** The tenth commandment forbids all desire to take or to keep unjustly what belongs to others, and also forbids envy at their success.

- It is permissible to seek material prosperity if we do so honestly and do not expose ourselves to the proximate dangers of sin.

> `"The eye of the envious is wicked" (Ecclesiasticus 14:8).`

> `"Take heed and guard yourself from all covetousness, for a man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions" (Luke 12:15).`

> `"For covetousness is the root of all evils, and some in their eagerness to get rich have strayed from the faith and have involved themselves in many troubles" (1 Timothy 6:10).`

> `"Let your manner of life be without avarice; be content with what you have, for he himself has said, 'I will not leave thee, neither will I forsake thee' " (Hebrew 13:5).`

### IMPORTANT POINTS ABOUT THE 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th COMMANDMENTS

- The seventh and eighth commandments are concerned primarily with our duties toward two possessions of our- neighbor his material goods and his good reputation. Because human beings are inclined to be selfish and neglectful of the rights of others, God considered it necessary to lay down the explicit commands: "Thou shalt not steal" ... "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor". Like the other commandments, these two commandments actually prescribe more obligations than those which they explicitly assert. The seventh commandment forbids not only stealing but every type of dishonest dealing; the eighth forbids not only falsehood but also many other sins of the tongue such as gossiping, the unlawful revelation of secrets, etc.
    
- The ninth and tenth commandments are related to the sixth and seventh- the ninth forbidding interior sins regarding matters of purity, while the sixth forbids external acts; the tenth forbidding those internal sins the external performance of which is forbidden by the seventh commandment.
    
- In our days there is much dishonesty, due largely to the excessive desire of people for riches and luxuries. In business, in politics, even in the home, many people are so anxious to enrich themselves that they are entirely unconcerned with the rights of their fellow men. Moreover, crimes of theft and robbery, often accompanied by violence or even murder, are becoming more and more common.
    
- Sometimes people buy stolen goods knowingly, and apparently do not realize that they have no claim to them but that they must give them back to the real owner. Indeed, even if a person buys stolen goods without realizing that they have been stolen, he may not keep them when he finds out that they were stolen if he knows the owner. If the owner appears and proves his right to the goods, the man who has bought them must restore them, even though the owner makes no recompense for the price the recipient has paid; but the latter has a right to get his money back from the thief who sold him the goods.
    
- The civil law is unable to accomplish much toward preventing these violations of the seventh commandment. True, people are sent to prison for theft when they are captured. But many escape the law; many others commit sins of dishonesty in so clever a way that there is no civil law to cover their case. But they do not escape the all-seeing eye of God. And no matter how successfully a person may have acquired dishonest gain, no matter how prosperous he may have made himself at the expense of his fellow men, death will come in a few brief years to separate him from his riches and to summon him to judgment before the throne of an all-just God.
    
- Many persons, by not paying their just debts, are guilty of sins against the seventh commandment. Some claim that they are unable to pay, yet they continue to buy luxuries, a fact which shows that they are not sincere. There are even some who deliberately refuse to pay a debt even though they know it was contracted, if the creditor has no written proof of his claim. God's law of justice is not limited to what can be proved in a civil court.
    
- Sins of the tongue which injure others are also prevalent. Without the least qualm of conscience men lie to their fellow men. There are many who gravely injure the reputation of their fellows by their uncharitable, often false, remarks and stories. Backbiting, tale-bearing, the violation of secrets that one should keep, rash judgments-how common these are today!
    
- Catholics, followers of Our Lord who was so attentive to the rights of others, should try to lead men to observe these commandments-and the best way is to inspire them by good example. We must be strictly honest in our dealings with others. Even when there is a question of something of slight value, we must never take it or keep it if it belongs to another. How many, for example, seem to think that if they find something on the street, they are entitled to keep it without an attempt to find the owner! Similarly, we must watch over our speech, rejecting every form of falsehood, carefully avoiding anything that might wound our neighbor's character, shunning rash and harsh judgments about our neighbor. "Do not judge, that you may not be judged" (Matt. 7:1).

## Lesson 21: The Commandments of the Church; The First and Second Commandments `(Các Điều Răn của Giáo hội; Điều Răn thứ Nhất và thứ Hai)`

### Q. 279. Whence has the Catholic Church the right to make laws?

**A.** The Catholic Church has the right to make laws from Jesus Christ, who said to the apostles, the first bishops of His Church: "Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound also in heaven."

- The power of the Church to bind and to loose is known as "the power of the keys" and includes everything necessary for the government of the Church and for the direction of the faithful in order that they may attain their eternal destiny. The primary purpose of Church laws is the eternal salvation of men.
    
- The Church has power from Christ to make laws and to enforce their observance. It is a mortal sin to disobey a law of the Church in a serious matter, a venial sin in a slight matter. The Church has indirect power over those temporal matters which are necessary or useful for the salvation of men.
    

> `"Amen I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound also in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed also in heaven" (Matthew 18:18).`

> `"He therefore said to them again, 'Peace be to you! As the Father has sent me, I also send you' " (John 20:21).`

### Q. 280. By whom is this right to make laws exercised?

**A.** This right to make laws is exercised by the bishops, the successors of the apostles, and especially by the Pope, who as the successor of the chief of the apostles, Saint Peter, has the right to make laws for the universal Church.

- The Roman Pontiff has full, supreme, ordinary (that is, in virtue of his office), and immediate jurisdiction over the universal Church.
    
- All the bishops of the Church assembled in a general council in union with the Pope can make laws for the universal Church. A residential bishop or one who is empowered by the Holy See as an Ordinary, whether invested with the episcopal character or not, has immediate jurisdiction over his own diocese or territory.
    

*See Scripture, question 137, Matthew 28:18-20; question 14, Matthew 16:17-19.*

1.  To assist at Mass on all Sundays and holydays of obligation.
2.  To fast and to abstain on the days appointed.
3.  To confess our sins at least once a year.
4.  To receive Holy Communion during the Easter time.
5.  To contribute to the support of the Church.
6.  To observe the laws of the Church concerning marriage.

### Q. 282. What sin does a Catholic commit who through his own fault misses Mass on a Sunday or holyday of obligation?

**A.** A Catholic who through his own fault misses Mass on a Sunday or holyday of obligation commits a mortal sin. 29

- The grave obligation to hear Mass on Sunday and holydays of obligation does not bind the following: first, those who must care for the sick; second, those whose illness does not permit them to go outdoors; third, those who live a considerable distance from a church; fourth, those who must give immediate attention to urgent work. A person in doubt about this obligation should consult a priest.

> *`See Scripture, question 236.`*

### Q. 283. Which are the holydays of obligation in the United States?

**A.** The holydays of obligation in the United States are these six:

1.  Christmas Day (December 25)

### Q. 286. What is a fast day?

**A.** A fast day is a day on which only one full meal is allowed, but in the morning and evening some food may be taken, the quantity and quality of which are determined by approved local custom.

- The one full meal may be taken either at noontime or in the evening. At this meal only may meat may be taken. To take liquid does not break one's fast, provided it is not equivalent to food. Malted milk or cream, for example, is equivalent to food.

### Q. 287. Who are obliged to observe the fast days of the Church?

**A.** All baptized persons between the ages of twenty-one and fifty-nine are obliged to observe the fast days of the Church, unless they are excused or dispensed.

- The sick and those who do extremely hard labor are excused from fasting. A person who is in doubt regarding the obligation to fast should consult a priest.

### Q. 288. What is a day of abstinence?

**A.** A day of abstinence is a day on which we are not allowed the use of meat.

### Q. 289. Who are obliged to observe the abstinence days of the Church?

**A.** All baptized persons seven years of age or over who have attained the use of reason are obliged to observe the abstinence days of the Church, unless they are excused or dispensed.

- The sick who need meat, persons who do extremely hard work, and those who would otherwise be deprived of sufficient food are excused from the law of abstinence.
    
- For a just cause, a parish priest can dispense his subjects from the law of fast or of abstinence, or of both, in particular cases. He can dispense individuals or particular families of his parish. He can grant this dispensation to his subjects even when they are outside the limits of his parish, and also to visitors who are, at the time, in his parish. A bishop enjoys the same power with respect to his diocese.
    
- Furthermore, the bishop of a diocese, when there is a gathering of many people, or when there is question of public health, can dispense a particular locality, or even the whole diocese, from the law of fast or of abstinence, or of both. The bishop can give faculties to dispense from the law of fast and abstinence to particular priests or to the confessors of the diocese.
    

### Q. 290. Why does the Church command us to fast and to abstain?

**A.** The Church commands us to fast and to abstain in order that we may control the desires of the flesh, raise our minds more freely to God, and make satisfaction for sin.

- It is not because meat and other foods are evil in themselves that the Church prescribes days of fast and abstinence. The Church commands us to deny ourselves for the glory of God and the good of our souls.

> `"Prayer is good with fasting and alms: more than to lay up treasures of gold" (Tobias 12:8).`

> `"Now therefore saith the Lord: 'Be converted to me with all your heart, in fasting ...' " (Joel 2:12).`

> `"Then Jesus was led into the desert by the Spirit, to be tempted by the devil. And after fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry" (Matthew 4:1 -2).`

> `"And when you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, who disfigure their faces in order to appear to men as fasting. Amen I say to you, they have received their reward. But thou, when thou dost fast, anoint thy head and wash thy face, so that thou mayest not be seen fasting by men, but by thy Father, who is in secret; and thy Father, who sees in secret, will reward thee" (Matthew 6:16-18).`

### Q. 291. Why does the Church make Friday a day of abstinence?

**A.** The Church makes Friday a day of abstinence to remind us of Our Lord's death on Good Friday.

### Q. 292. How can we know the days appointed for fast or abstinence?

**A.** We can know the days appointed for fast or abstinence from the instructions of our bishops and priests.

- From the general laws of the Church, we know the following regulations: first, abstinence binds on all Fridays; second, fast and abstinence bind on Ash Wednesday, the Fridays and Saturdays of Lent, the Ember Days, and the vigils of Pentecost, the Immaculate Conception, All Saints and Christmas. The Ember Days are twelve in number, three in each season, namely, the Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday after December 13; after the first Sunday of Lent; after Pentecost; and after September 14; third, fast binds on all the other days of Lent.
    
- There is no obligation of fast or of abstinence on Sundays and holydays of obligation except when the holydays are in the season of Lent.
    
- In the United States at present, most dioceses have special rules regarding fast and abstinence.
    

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT THE 1st AND 2nd COMMANDMENTS OF THE CHURCH

- As is customary in every organized society, in the Church the lawful rulers have the authority to make laws for the other members. Christ Himself explicitly gave this power to the first bishops, the apostles, and from them it has been passed down through the centuries to the bishops of the present day. The fullest measure of this authority resides in the Pope, the chief bishop of the entire Church who can make laws for all its members, whereas other bishops can legislate for their respective dioceses only.
    
- The laws of the Church are all directed to one great purpose-to bring men to eternal salvation. For more than nineteen centuries the Church has had experience in making laws; in her legislative action she is guided by the Holy Ghost. Indeed, on account of the infallibility of the Church it would be impossible for her to pass any general law that would be harmful to the faith or morals of Christians. Like a good mother, the Church is not too severe in her laws. She knows the inclinations of human nature and human frailty; she is ready to dispense from her laws when there is good reason for a dispensation. Moreover, the Church is always ready to adapt her legislation to local conditions and to the customs of different nations.
    
- What are known as the six commandments of the Church are in reality certain laws selected from the body of the Church's legislative enactments, stating the more urgent duties of the practical Catholic. The two commandments considered in this lesson concern the two important virtues of religion and temperance. In order that her children may practice religion, the Church prescribes that they assist at the sacrifice of the Mass, the most sublime act of Christianship, at least on every Sunday and on certain great feasts. In order that they may practice temperance the Church prescribes fast and abstinence at certain times -some days being days of both fast and abstinence, others imposing only one of these forms of self-denial.
    
- These laws, like all the laws of the Church, are reasonable and easy to observe. The first of these two commandments calls for only one hour of our time every Sunday and on six other days in the course of the year.
    
- This is a grave precept, so that one who misses Mass, or a considerable portion of it, on a Sunday or holyday by his own fault is guilty of a mortal sin. If a person failed to come before the Offertory but was present from the Offertory to the end of the Mass, he would substantially fulfill his obligation but he would be guilty of a venial sin, in the supposition that the omission was culpable. But a person would not substantially satisfy his obligation if he were present only from the beginning of the Offertory through the Communion. It is permitted to fulfill the obligation by hearing successively portions of two Masses which together constitute an entire Mass, as long as one is present at both the Consecration and the Communion of one of the Masses.
    
- In former centuries there were many more holydays of obligation than at present. In fact, even today Catholics in the United States are dispensed from the observance of four of the ten holydays that are prescribed for the universal Church. Similarly, our present-day laws regarding fast and abstinence are much easier than those of the early Church, when the precept of fasting forbade a person to touch food until late in the afternoon. Even at the present day among the Catholics of the Oriental rites the laws of fasting are much stricter than those binding Latin Catholics. And the Church is quite lenient in granting dispensations when there is a good reason. Thus, in the United States the laws of fast and abstinence have been considerably mitigated. For example, besides the points mentioned in the lesson, the soldiers and sailors of our country are dispensed from fast and abstinence on all days except Ash Wednesday, Good Friday, the Vigil of Christmas, and all of Holy Saturday, and if the soldier or sailor lives with his family, all the members share in this privilege.
    
- Generally speaking, the laws of the Church begin to bind only when a Catholic has passed his seventh birthday and has attained the use of reason. This rule holds in regard to the law of abstinence and of attendance at Mass on Sundays and holydays. However the law of fasting binds only those who have passed their twenty-first birthday and have not yet passed their fifty-ninth birthday. On the other hand, a child who has attained the use of reason but is not yet seven years old is obliged to obey the law of annual Holy Communion.
    
- The two commandments we have considered in this lesson are a good test of a Catholic's loyalty to his religion. Catholics who observe them faithfully are usually practical Catholics, while those who habitually neglect Mass and the laws of fast and abstinence-particularly the Friday abstinence are Catholics only in name and are in grave danger of losing their souls.

## Lesson 22: The Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Commandments of the Church `(Điều Răn thứ Ba, thứ Tư, thứ Năm, và thứ Sáu của Giáo hội)`

### Q. 293. What is meant by the commandment to confess our sins at least once a year?

**A.** By the commandment to confess our sins at least once a year is meant that we are strictly obliged to make a good confession within the year, if we have a mortal sin to confess.

- This commandment binds all Catholics who have attained the use of reason. One who commits a mortal sin after Baptism is obliged by divine law to receive the sacrament of Penance. If this is impossible, one must make an act of perfect contrition and have the desire to receive the sacrament.
- Baptized persons in the state of mortal sin who are in danger of death are obliged to receive the sacrament of Penance. Owing to the obligation to receive Holy Communion at Easter time, itis customary to discharge the duty of annual confession at the same time. One guilty of mortal sin who does not fulfill the precept of annual confession commits another mortal sin.

> `"He therefore said to them again, 'Peace be to you! As the Father has sent me, I also send you.' When he had said this, he breathed upon them, and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit; whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained' " (John 20:21-23).`

> `"Confess, therefore, your sins to one another" (James 5:16).`

> `"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we acknowledge our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all iniquity. If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us" (1 John 1:8-10).`

### Q. 294. Why should we go to confession frequently?

**A.** We should go to confession frequently because frequent confession greatly helps us to overcome temptation, to keep in the state of grace, and to grow in virtue.

- It is not necessary to go to confession before every Communion, provided one has not sinned mortally. One can best be guided about frequent confession by one's confessor.

### Q. 295. What sin does a Catholic commit who neglects to receive Holy Communion worthily during the Easter time?

**A.** A Catholic who neglects to receive Holy Communion worthily during the Easter time commits a mortal sin.

- This commandment obliges all Catholics who have the use of reason, Children who have completed seven years of age are presumed to have the use of reason. One does not fulfill this commandment of the Church by a sacrilegious Communion. One who has failed to receive Holy Communion within the appointed time is obliged to receive the Holy Eucharist as soon as possible.

> `"Jesus therefore said to them, 'Amen, amen, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, you shall not have life in you. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has life everlasting and I will raise him up on the last day. For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed' " (John 6:54-56).`

### Q. 296. What is the Easter time in the United States?

**A.** The Easter time in the United States begins on the first Sunday of Lent and ends on Trinity Sunday.

- Trinity Sunday, or the Sunday after Pentecost, is eight weeks after Easter.

### Q. 297. What is meant by the commandment to contribute to the support of the Church?

**A.** By the commandment to contribute to the support of the Church is meant that each of us is obliged to bear his fair share of the financial burden of the Holy See, of the diocese, and of the parish.

- The Church instituted by Christ has the right to all the means it needs for the fulfillment of its divine commission, for divine worship, and for the support of the clergy. The Church has the right to determine how to secure the necessary means without civil interference. Mass stipends are given to the priest, not in payment for the spiritual benefits received, but as a means of his support.

> `"When thou shalt take the sum of the children of Israel according to their number, every one of them shall give a price for their souls to the Lord: and there shall be no scourge among them, when they shall be reckoned. And this shall every one give that passeth at the naming, half a sicle according to the standard of the temple" (Exodus 30:12-13).`

> `"The priests and Levites, and all that are of the same tribe, shall have no part nor inheritance with the rest of Israel: because they shall eat the sacrifices of the Lord, and his oblation. And they shall receive nothing else of the possession of their brethren: for the Lord himself is their inheritance, as he hath said to them. This shall be the priest's due from the people, and from them that offer victims. Whether they sacrifice an ox, or a sheep, they shall give to the priest the shoulder and the breast: The first fruits also of corn, of wine, and of oil, and a part of the wool from the shearing of their sheep. For the Lord thy God hath chosen him of all thy tribes, to stand and to minister to the name of the Lord: him and his sons forever. If a Levite go out of any one of the cities throughout all Israel, in which he dwelleth, and have a longing mind to come to the place which the Lord shall choose: he shall minister in the name of the Lord his God, as all his brethren the Levites do, that shall stand at that time before the Lord. He shall receive the same portion of food that the rest do: besides that which is due to him in his own city, by succession from his fathers" (Deuteronomy 18:1-8).`

> `"Do not keep gold, or silver, or no wallet for your journey, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor staff; for the laborer deserves his living" (Matthew 10:910).`

> `"So also the Lord directed that those who preach the gospel should have their living from the gospel" (1 Corinthians 9:14).`

### Q. 298. What is the ordinary law of the Church to be observed at the wedding of a Catholic?

**A.** The ordinary law of the Church to be observed at the wedding of a Catholic is this: A Catholic can contract a true marriage only in the presence of an authorized priest and two witnesses. 30

- Before marriage the contracting parties have a serious obligation to answer truthfully all questions asked by the priest concerning their freedom to marry. These questions are asked for the protection of the sacrament and the parties concerned.

### Q. 299. Does the Church forbid Catholics to contract marriage with certain persons?

**A.** The Church does forbid Catholics to contract marriage with certain persons, and the following are examples: first, a marriage with a non-Catholic; this is a mixed marriage second, a marriage with a second cousin, or any relative closer than a second cousin.

- Some other examples of marriages forbidden by the Church are: first, marriage of a boy who is not sixteen years old or of a girl who is not fourteen years of age; second, marriage between a godparent and a godchild; third, marriage between a widow or a widower and the near relatives of the deceased spouse.

### Q. 300. Why does the Church forbid Catholics to marry non-Catholics?

**A.** The Church forbids Catholics to marry non-Catholics because mixed marriages often bring about family discord, loss of faith on the part of the Catholic, and neglect of the religious training of the children.

> `"And it is better to die without children, than to leave ungodly children" (Ecclesiasticus 16:4).`

> `"You therefore, brethren, since you know this beforehand, be on your guard lest, carried away by the error of the foolish, you fall away from your steadfastness" (2 Peter 3:17).`

### Q. 301. Does the Church ever permit mixed marriages or marriages between close relatives?

**A.** For grave reasons the Church sometimes permits mixed marriages or marriages between close relatives; such a permission is called a dispensation.

- The divine law forbids mixed marriages as long as there is danger to the faith of the Catholic party or of the offspring. The Church, before granting the dispensation for a mixed marriage, demands that this danger be removed and asks that guarantees to that effect be given by explicit promises made before a representative of ecclesiastical authority.
    
- The non-Catholic party must promise not to endanger the faith of the Catholic; both parties must promise that the children born of the marriage will be baptized in the Catholic Church alone and educated solely in the Catholic religion. The Catholic party, moreover, must promise to strive for the conversion of the non-Catholic party by prayer and good example.
    
- Those who do not understand that marriage is a sacrament divinely instituted and that only one Church was established by the Lord Christ are apt to consider these regulations of the Church rigorous and unreasonable. The Church is the divine guardian of faith and of the religion established by Christ. It is opposed to mixed marriages and does all that is possible to discourage them.
    

### Q. 302. Does the Church allow Catholics to marry during Lent and Advent?

**A.** The Church allows Catholics to marry during Lent and Advent, provided they do so quietly and without much ceremony; a Nuptial Mass is forbidden during these seasons.

### Q. 303. What is a Nuptial Mass?

**A.** A Nuptial Mass is a Mass which has special prayers to beg God's blessing on the married couple.

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT THE 3rd, 4th, 5th AND 6th COMMANDMENTS OF THE CHURCH

- The third and fourth commandments of the Church are concerned with the reception of the two sacraments that are the principal sources of supernatural strength in the Christian life-Penance and the Holy Eucharist. One would think that every Catholic, realizing the great benefits given to his soul by these two sacraments, would need no special law obliging him to confess his sins and to nourish himself with the body and blood of Our Blessed Saviour. In the early days of the Church, it is true, no such legislation was needed; Christians made frequent use of these sacraments, particularly the Holy Eucharist, without the necessity of compulsion. But when fervor cooled, the Church was obliged to make laws in the matter. For a time Catholics were bound to go to confession and to receive Holy Communion three times a year-at Christmas, Easter and Pentecost. Later, at the Fourth Council of the Lateran in the year 1215, the law was mitigated to its present form, prescribing the reception of these sacraments at least once a year, the Holy Communion being received in the Easter season. For this reason the obligatory reception of Holy Eucharist is known as the "Easter Duty." According to the general law of the Church the period for receiving the Easter communion lasts only two weeks, from Palm Sunday to Low Sunday; but by special privilege this period is extended in the United States to fourteen weeks, from the first Sunday in Lent to Trinity Sunday.
    
- If a person has no mortal sin to confess, he is not bound to receive the sacrament of Penance even once a year either by the law of God or by any general law of the Church. However, it is surely advisable to go to confession regularly even though one has no mortal sins to confess. Needless to say, annual confession and Communion represent the very least that can be expected of any member of the Church. We know, of course, that the other occasion when these sacraments must be received- the Holy Eucharist by all, Penance by those who have mortal sin to confess-is when a sick or very old person is in danger of death. Holy Communion on this occasion is called the Viaticum, which means "Food for a journey," the long journey into eternity.
    
- The fifth commandment of the Church imposes on Catholics the obligation of doing their part toward supplying the material needs of religion. Catholics share in the benefits of their churches and schools; hence they must share in the expense of building and maintaining them. Catholics benefit by the services of their clergy and religious; hence they must contribute toward their support. In the Old Law God obliged the Jewish people to give a substantial portion of their possessions to the service of religion; Our Lord Himself spoke of a similar obligation toward those preaching the Gospel in His name, when He said, on sending His disciples to announce His message "The laborer deserves his living" (Matt. 10:10). The laws of the Church in former ages imposed on Catholics in some places the obligation of giving tithes-that is, one tenth of their earnings. Nowadays, very few Catholics give anything near this proportion of their income to religion. But all should give generously, with the conviction that they are giving to God, rather than to their fellow-men.
    
- The sixth commandment of the Church refers to the sacrament of Matrimony. The Church has laid down a number of laws regulating marriage, because it is so important and holy a state, and the happiness of individuals and of the human race depends so much on the ideals and the conduct of married persons. Some of the more important Church laws have been mentioned in this lesson: but there are many others. One of the laws which all Catholics should seriously consider at the present day is that which forbids the marriage of Catholics with those who are not members of their Church. It is true, such marriages sometimes turn out successfully; sometimes they even serve as the occasion of the conversion of the non-Catholic to the true faith. But more frequently they injure the faith of the Catholic and of the children. Hence, the Church's first advice to young people thinking of marriage is: Marry those of your own religion. Even when the Church permits a mixed marriage, it demands that only a Catholic ceremony be used.
    
- According to the law of the Church, a Catholic cannot be married validly, whether he marries another Catholic or a non-Catholic, except in the presence of an authorized priest and two witnesses. By an authorized priest is meant a bishop (or a vicar general) within his diocese, a pastor within his parish, or a priest deputed by any of these within his respective territory. A Catholic who attempts to contract marriage before a non-Catholic clergyman not only commits a grave sin but also incurs the penalty of excommunication. However, when an authorized priest cannot be had or approached without grave inconvenience, there are two exceptional cases in which a Catholic can validly and lawfully marry without a priest: first, when one, at least, of the parties of the marriage is in danger of death; second, when it can be prudently foreseen that an authorized priest cannot be had for a month. In these two cases Catholics can contract a marriage validly and lawfully in the presence of two witnesses.

The nearest Catholic Church is 100 miles distant; and a priest comes to their camp only once every two months to say Mass and to administer the sacraments. The young couple decides to marry. They cannot get a car to journey to the church; and they know that the priest is not due to visit them for five weeks. May they marry even without the presence of a priest?

- Howard, an earnest Methodist, tells his fiancee Martha, a Catholic, that the Catholic Church is unjust in laying down the conditions it requires for a mixed marriage. He claims that the fair thing is to have two ceremonies, one in his church and one in the Catholic Church.

What should Martha reply, and what should she do if Howard persists in his demands?
