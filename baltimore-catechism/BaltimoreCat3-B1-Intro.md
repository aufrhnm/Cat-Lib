### Foreword by Father Connell, C.SS.R

`(Lời Nói Đầu của Linh mục Connell)`

> In the spring of 1949 the Official Baltimore Catechism, No. 3, was issued under the auspices of the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine. It contains the same questions and answers as Catechism No. 2, issued in 1941, but with considerable additional matter in the form of Scriptural quotations and more extensive doctrinal explanations. This Catechism No. 3 is the product of several years of study and compilation by a committee of competent theologians and catechists.
> 
> The present Catechism, entitled **THE NEW CONFRATERNITY EDITION OF THE REVISED BALTIMORE CATECHISM NO. 3**, presents the entire text of the Official Baltimore Catechism No. 3, with additions to each lesson; these additions comprise a section summarizing the most important truths pertinent to the subject of the lesson and two sets of study helps. I take this occasion to express my deep gratitude to Father Thomas Chapman, C.SS.R, who composed most of the "Problems and Exercises" which are found in the second set of study helps.
> 
> It is my earnest hope and prayer that all who study this Catechism will be enlightened by the Holy Spirit to perceive the truth, the beauty, and the inspiration of the doctrines taught by the Holy Catholic Church.
