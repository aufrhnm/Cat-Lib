## Lesson 31: Confession `(Xưng tội)`

### Q. 408. What is confession?

**A.** Confession is the telling of our sins to an authorized priest for the purpose of obtaining forgiveness.

- An authorized priest is one who has not only the power to forgive sins by reason of his ordination to the priesthood, but also the power of jurisdiction over the persons who come to him. He has this jurisdiction ordinarily from his bishop, or by reason of his office. 32

> `"I have confessed my sin to thee, and my fault I have not concealed; I said: 'I confess my iniquity to the Lord,' and thou didst forgive the guilt of my sin" (Psalm 31:5).`

> `"He that hideth his sins shall not prosper: but he that shall confess and forsake them shall obtain mercy" (Proverbs 28:13).`

> `"And this became known to all the Jews and Gentiles living in Ephesus, and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus came to be held in high honor. And many of those who believed kept coming, and openly confessed their practices" ( 17-18).`

### Q. 409. Why must we confess our sins?

**A.** We must confess our sins because Jesus Christ obliges us to do so in these words, spoken to the apostles and to their successors in the priesthood: "Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained."

> *`See Scripture, questions 380 and 384.`*

### Q. 410. How do these words of Christ oblige us to confess our sins?

**A.** These words of Christ oblige us to confess our sins because the priest cannot know whether he should forgive or retain our sins unless we tell them to him.

- The priest must judge the penitent. In order to act as judge the priest must know whether to forgive or to retain the penitent's sins. It would be impossible for the priest to decide, that is, to judge, whether or not the penitent should be forgiven unless the penitent made known the extent of his guilt and his sorrow.
- In the sacrament of Penance the priest acts also as the physician of the soul. He tells the penitent how to avoid sin and how to amend his life. Just as we tell a doctor about our bodily aches and pains in order that he can cure us, so also we tell our sins to the priest in order that he can suggest spiritual remedies.
- Since God has commanded us to confess our sins to the priest, as His representative, we should not let shame prevent us from doing so. The priest, as God's representative, will advise and encourage us, help us solve our doubts, guide our future conduct, and forgive our sins in the name of Christ. He will never, under any circumstances, not even to save his own life, make our sins known to anyone else. Priests, bishops, and even the Pope must also confess their sins to a priest.

### Q. 411. Is it necessary to confess every sin?

**A.** It is necessary to confess every mortal sin which has not yet been confessed and forgiven; it is not necessary to confess our venial sins, but it is better to do so.

- a) It is not necessary to confess venial sins because they do not deprive the soul of sanctifying grace.
- b) It is better to confess our venial sins because when we do so, we have more assurance that they are forgiven and because we receive from the sacrament of Penance special graces to help us avoid them in the future.

> *`See Scripture, question 408, Proverbs 28:13.`*

### Q. 412. What are the chief qualities of a good confession?

**A.** The chief qualities of a good confession are three: it must be humble, sincere, and entire.

### Q. 413. When is our confession humble?

**A.** Our confession is humble when we accuse ourselves of our sins with a conviction of guilt for having offended God.

> `"And the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee. I am no longer worthy to be called thy son' " (Luke 15:21).`

> `"O God, be merciful to me the sinner!" (Luke 18:13).`

### Q. 414. When is our confession sincere?

**A.** Our confession is sincere when we tell our sins honestly and frankly.

- We must manifest our humility and sincerity in confession by telling our sins clearly and distinctly so the priest can understand them.
- Persons who lack the power of speech may, if they wish, write a list of their sins for the priest. Persons who are hard of hearing should confess in places set aside for them so neither they nor the priest will be overheard.

### Q. 415. When is our confession entire?

**A.** Our confession is entire when we confess at least all our mortal sins, telling their kind, the number of times we have committed each sin, and any circumstances changing their nature.

- By the kind of sins is meant the class to which they belong, such as blasphemy, missing Mass, disobedience, theft. The best way to determine the different kinds of sin is to determine the virtue that has been violated or the commandment that has been broken. We must confess whether the sin was in thought, word, or deed. In most prayer books there are lists of sins which help us to determine the kinds of sins we have committed.
- Circumstances that change the nature of a sin are those that add some new kind of wickedness to the act we have done. For example, if a person kills another, he commits a sin of murder; but the killing of a cleric is a circumstance that adds a new wickedness to his act and makes it also a sin of sacrilege.

> `"And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: Say to the children of Israel: When a man or woman shall have committed any of all the sins that men are wont to commit, and by negligence shall have transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and offended: they shall confess their sin ..." (Numbers 5:5-7).`

### Q. 416. What are we to do if without our fault we forget to confess a mortal sin?

**A.** If without our fault we forget to confess a mortal sin, we may receive Holy Communion, because we have made a good Confession and the sin is forgiven; but we must tell the sin in confession if it again comes to our mind.

- There are times when a person can receive the sacrament of Penance without telling the nature and number of all his sins. A dying person, for example, or a large number of soldiers going into battle may not have time for a detailed confession. Before receiving absolution they must admit that they have sinned, that they are sorry, and that they want to be absolved. Those who have confessed in this general way must, in their next confession, tell all their sins according to their nature, number, and circumstances that change their nature.

### Q. 417. What happens if we knowingly conceal a mortal sin in confession?

**A.** If we knowingly conceal a mortal sin in confession, the sins we confess are not forgiven; moreover, we commit a mortal sin of sacrilege.

- To conceal a mortal sin in confession is a sacrilege, because it is a grievous abuse of the sacrament of Penance, a sacred institution of Christ.

> *`See Scripture, question 408, Proverbs 28:13.`*

### Q. 418. What must a person do who has knowingly concealed a mortal sin in confession?

**A.** A person who has knowingly concealed a mortal sin in confession must confess that he has made a bad confession, tell the sin he has concealed, mention the sacraments he has received since that time, and confess all the other mortal sins he has committed since his last good confession.

### Q. 419. Why should a sense of shame and fear of telling our sins to the priest never lead us to conceal a mortal sin in confession?

**A.** A sense of shame and fear of telling our sins to the priest should never lead us to conceal a mortal sin in confession because the priest, who represents Christ Himself, is bound by the seal of the sacrament of Penance never to reveal anything that has been confessed to him.

- The priest may not speak about anything he has heard in confession even to the penitent who told it to him, unless the penitent himself willingly permits it.
- If any person overhears something that is told in confession by another, he may not speak of it to anyone. A person ordinarily should not mention to others what he has told in confession.

> `"Be not ashamed to confess thy sins" (Ecclesiasticus 4:31).`

> `"He who hears you, hears me; and he who rejects you, rejects me; and he who rejects me, rejects him who sent me" (Luke 10:16).`

### Q. 420. Why does the priest give us a penance after confession?

**A.** The priest gives us a penance after confession that we may make some atonement to God for our sins, receive help to avoid them in the future, and make some satisfaction for the temporal punishment due to them.

- It is a sin deliberately to omit the penance received in confession, a mortal sin if the penance is grave and imposed for a grave sin, a venial sin if the penance is slight.
- If a person intended to perform the penance at the time he received it, the sins he told in confession are forgiven; but he is guilty of a new sin afterward when he deliberately omits the penance.
- A person should follow exactly the instructions of the priest as to the manner and time of performing the penance. If the priest does not give such instructions, it is best to perform the penance immediately, or as soon as possible.

> `"And David said to Nathan: I have sinned against the Lord. And Nathan said to David: The Lord also hath taken away thy sin. Thou shalt not die. Nevertheless, because thou hast given occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, for this thing, the child that is born to thee, shall surely die" (2 Kings 12:13-14).`

> `"Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to thee, and redeem thou thy sins with alms and thy iniquities with works of mercy to the poor: perhaps he will forgive thy offenses" (-24).`

> `"Now therefore saith the Lord: Be converted to me with all your heart, in fasting and in weeping and in mourning" (Joel 2:12).`

### Q. 421. What kinds of punishment are due to sin?

**A.** Two kinds of punishment are due to sin: the eternal punishment of hell, due to unforgiven mortal sins, and temporal punishment, lasting only for a time, due to venial sins and also to mortal sins after they have been forgiven.

- We know that God demands temporal punishment for mortal sins even after they have been forgiven, because God Himself has made this known by divine revelation.
- Christ, by His death on the cross, made more than adequate satisfaction to atone for all the temporal punishment due to all the sins of mankind; but God wants us to perform works of penance ourselves to receive all the benefits of the satisfaction of Christ.

> `"If anyone does not abide in me, he shall be cast outside as the branch and wither; and they shall gather them up and cast them into the fire, and they shall burn" (John 15:6).`

> `"But if anyone build upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, and straw-the work of each will be made manifest, for the day the Lord will declare it, since the day is to be revealed in fire. The fire will assay the quality of everyone's work: if his work abides which he has built thereon, he will receive reward; if his work burns he will lose his reward, but himself will be saved, yet so as through fire" (1 Corinthians 3:12-15).`

> `'But as for the cowardly and unbelieving, and abominable and murderers, and fornicators and sorcerers, and idolaters and all liars, their portion shall be in the pool that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death" (Apocalypse 21:8).`

### Q. 422. Does the sacrament of Penance, worthily received, always take away all punishment?

**A.** The sacrament of Penance, worthily received, always takes away all eternal punishment; but it does not always take away all temporal punishment.

- The sacrament of Baptism takes away all punishment, temporal as well as eternal, due not only to original sin but also to all actual sins committed before Baptism.
- The sacrament of Penance, however, does not always take away all temporal punishment due to sins committed after Baptism. The dispositions with which one receives the sacrament of Penance determine the amount of temporal punishment which will be taken away.

> *`See Scripture, question 420.`*

### Q. 423. Why does God require temporal punishment for sin?

**A.** God requires temporal punishment for sin to satisfy His justice, to teach us the great evil of sin, and to warn us not to sin again.

### Q. 424. Where do we pay the debt of our temporal punishment?

**A.** We pay the debt of our temporal punishment either in this life or in purgatory.

- We should do as much penance as we can in this life for our sins. Our works of satisfaction in this life help us to merit greater glory in heaven.
- The debt of temporal punishment is paid in this life according to the penance imposed and the devotion with which it is performed. The priest is obliged to impose greater or less penance in proportion to the gravity and number of the sins confessed.

> *`See Scripture, question 421, 1 Corinthians 3:12-15.`*

### Q. 425. What are the chief means of satisfying the debt of our temporal punishment, besides the penance imposed after confession?

**A.** Besides the penance imposed after confession, the chief means of satisfying the debt of our temporal punishment are: prayer, attending Mass, fasting, almsgiving, the works of mercy, the patient endurance of sufferings, and indulgences.

> `"Prayer is good with fasting and alms: more than to lay up treasures of gold. For alms delivereth from death: and the same is that which purgeth away sins, and maketh to find mercy and life everlasting" (Tobias 12:8-9).`

> *`See Scripture, question 420.`*

## Lesson 32: How To Make a Good Confession `(Cách Xưng tội cho Tốt)`

### Q. 426. Before entering the confessional, how should we prepare ourselves for a good confession?

**A.** Before entering the confessional, we should prepare ourselves for a good confession by taking sufficient time not only to examine our conscience but, especially, to excite in our hearts sincere sorrow for our sins and a firm purpose not to commit them again.

- Respect for the sacrament of Penance requires serious preparation for its reception. Reverence in church, a careful examination of conscience, exciting sincere sorrow for our sins, and patience in awaiting one's turn to approach the confessional, are marks of respect for the sacrament.

### Q. 427. How should we begin our confession?

**A.** We should begin our confession in this manner: Entering the confessional, we kneel, and making the sign of the cross we say to the priest: "Bless me, Father, for I have sinned;" and then we tell how long it has been since our last confession.

### Q. 428. After telling the time of our last confession, what do we confess?

**A.** After telling the time of our last confession, if we have committed any mortal sins since that time, we must confess them and also any that we have forgotten in previous confessions, telling the nature and number of each; we may also confess any venial sins we wish to mention.

- In the confessional it is necessary to speak distinctly and loud enough to be heard by the priest, but not so loud that other persons standing or kneeling near the confessional can hear.
- A person should not attempt to offer excuses for himself; but he should mention those conditions or circumstances that increase or decrease his guilt.
- It is not necessary to mention acts that are not sins. It is not necessary, for example, to mention that one has eaten meat on a day of abstinence unless it was eaten deliberately with the knowledge that it was a day of abstinence. Nor is it necessary to mention that one has missed Mass on Sunday if one was seriously ill and could not go to Mass.
- Other persons should not be mentioned in confession unless it is necessary to indicate the species of sin. The faults or sins of others should not be mentioned. When it is necessary to refer to others in confession, their names must never be mentioned.

### Q. 429. What should we do if we cannot remember the exact number of our mortal sins?

**A.** If we cannot remember the exact number of our mortal sins, we should tell the number as nearly as possible, or say how often we have committed the sins in a day, a week, a month, or a year.

- If we discover, after confession, that we have unintentionally accused ourselves of more sins than were committed, there is no need to make any further mention of it.
- If we discover, after confession, that we unintentionally omitted some mortal sins, or failed to state the exact species, or mentioned a smaller number than were actually committed, we must mention the fact in our next confession.

### Q. 430. What should we do when we have committed no mortal sin since our last confession?

**A.** When we have committed no mortal sin since our last confession, we should confess our venial sins or some sin told in a previous confession, for which we are again sorry, in order that the priest may give us absolution.

- Even though we have already confessed a sin of our past life in a previous confession, we can again be sincerely sorry for it, especially if it is a mortal sin. This sincere sorrow is sufficient to enable the priest to give us absolution even if we confess only slight sins for which we do not have sufficient sorrow.

> `"Remember not the sins of my youth nor my offenses. According to thy mercy remember thou me, for thy goodness' sake, O Lord" (Psalm 24:7).`

### Q. 431. How should we end our confession?

**A.** We should end our confession by saying: "I am sorry for these and all the sins of my past life, especially for ..." Then it is well to tell one or several of the sins we have previously confessed and for which we are particularly sorry.

- A general confession is one in which all sins told in previous confessions, either of our whole life or of a part of our life, are repeated.
- Sometimes it is necessary to make a general confession. If a person has made a bad confession, or several of them, he must repeat all mortal sins committed since his last good confession, even though he has told them in previous confessions.
- Sometimes it is advisable to make a general confession, for example, when a person is about to enter a different state of life, such as the married state, or the priesthood, or the religious life. A person should consult his confessor before making a general confession.

### Q. 432. What should we do after confessing our sins?

**A.** After confessing our sins, we should answer truthfully any question the priest asks, seek advice if we feel that we need any, listen carefully to the spiritual instruction and counsel of the priest, and accept the penance he gives us.

- If, for some reason, it would be impossible or too difficult for us to perform the penance given by the priest, we should ask him to give us some other penance. If there is any matter of a spiritual nature that is bothering us, we should not hesitate to ask the priest for his advice.

### Q. 433. What should we do when the priest is giving us absolution?

**A.** When the priest is giving us absolution, we should say from our heart the act of contrition in a tone to be heard by him.

- contains all the requisites of an act of perfect contrition.

### Q. 434. What should we do after leaving the confessional?

**A.** After leaving the confessional we should return thanks to God for the sacrament we have received, beg Our Lord to supply for the imperfections of our confession, and promptly and devoutly perform our penance.

- is a model prayer of thanksgiving.

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT THE MANNER OF MAKING A GOOD CONFESSION

- Well-bred persons are most exact in observing the rules of politeness. When they are in the company of others, they are always careful to act according to the customs approved by society. Catholics too have certain rules of politeness which they are expected to observe in the performance of religious functions. However, there is a great difference between these rules and those adopted by people of the world. For the sole object of the courtesies of the world is to please human beings, while the purpose of the acts of politeness we practice in performing our religious duties is to please God. Whenever we take part in any function of the Church- whether it be assistance at Mass, the reception of the sacraments, or participation in a procession or a special devotion-we should remember that we are in the presence of the King of kings, to do homage to Him. This thought should inspire us to be most observant of all the rules of deportment the particular function imposes on us.
- There is no occasion better suited for testing our Catholic courtesy than the reception of the sacrament of Penance. Sad to say, there are some Catholics who show a great lack of respect and seriousness in the reception of this sublime sacrament. They walk into church, gazing around as if it were a theater. Instead of a reverent genuflection, they make a slight inclination and slouch into a pew. A minute or two suffices for preparation; then they approach the confessional, perhaps forcing their way ahead of others who had the first right. They make their confession in a careless, slipshod way, rendering if necessary for the priest to put a number of questions regarding the nature and number of their sins. The act of contrition is hastily mumbled; when they leave the confessional, they say their penance as fast as possible and hasten from the church. Strange to say, many of these persons are most careful in obeying the rules of politeness when they are at some social function in a parlor or dining-room; but in the house of God, they are ill-mannered and disrespectful.
- The well-mannered Catholic shows from the moment he enters the church that he realizes he is in the presence of Our Divine Saviour. His genuflection is performed properly, the knee touching the Floor. His preparation for confession is careful and exact, without being scrupulous. He makes a fervent act of contrition, and waits his turn to enter the confessional. He confesses his sins exactly and sincerely but without unnecessary details. The confessor has no difficulty with his confession; he gives him some advice, which is attentively received, and imparts absolution while the penitent humbly and fervently repeats his act of contrition. On leaving the confessional he not only recites his penance but also spends some time in thanking God for having received the pardon of his sins and in begging strength to avoid sin in future. Such a Catholic is conscious that in approaching the confessional he is really kneeling before Our Lord Himself to hear from His lips the words: "Thy sins are forgiven."
- It may happen that after confession a person will forget what penance he has received. In that event he should return to the confessor and ask him to repeat it, if he can do so without much inconvenience. If, however, he would have to wait a considerable length of time or suffer some other grave inconvenience before he could again get to the confessor, he can consider himself free from the penance, though it would be advisable for him to say some prayers in satisfaction for his debt of temporal punishment.

#### B. PROBLEMS AND EXERCISES.

*(Answer the questions orally or write them as your teacher may direct):*

- Justin, 12 years old, is playing in front of the church. Suddenly, he gets the bright idea to go to confession. He hasn't been there for more than three months. Discontinuing the play, he enters the church hurriedly, and out of breath, genuflects quickly, and goes straight into the confessional. What do you think about Justin's preparation for confession?
- Thecla has recovered from a serious heart ailment. She goes to confession after an absence of five weeks. While a patient in the Jewish hospital she missed Mass on four Sundays. Among her sins she accuses herself of missing Mass. What have you to say concerning her confession?
- Wallace, a careless Catholic, attending public school, has been away from the sacraments for nine months. He is making the confession for his Easter Duty Communion. In telling his sins he accuses himself this way: "I missed Mass lots of times; I ate meat on Friday many times etc." Point out the serious defect in Wallace's manner of confessing.
- Pearl is worried about the confession she made three days ago. She told the priest she stole two expensive rings and a valuable necklace; but she forgot to mention that she missed her Easter Duty. Is the sin of missing Easter Duty still on her soul? Explain your reply.
- Louis, who formerly was a very careless Catholic, is now changed for the better. He is somewhat upset on discovering that he did not tell the exact truth in his last confession. He confessed that he missed Mass twelve times; but it was only ten times. Advise him how to act.
- Annabelle is earnestly striving to be a saint. At her weekly confession she can't find any sin of the past week to confess. The nearest thing to sin that she remembers is that she spoke in church to an old man who asked her a question. So she confesses: "I spoke in church once. That's all, Father." Did she commit a sin in answering the old man? What do you suggest that penitents add to their confession when they have no new sins to tell, or only imperfections? Why?
- Vincent is about to enter an order of teaching brothers. He is making his confession before taking the habit. Must he make a general confession, or is a general confession only advisable.
- Next Saturday, Hedwig is going to be married to Innocent at a Nuptial Mass. Friday night both of them are going to confession. What kind of a confession do you advise them to make, their regular monthly confession, or a general confession? Why?
- Lester is a very nervous lad of fourteen. The thought of going to confession tortures him, yet he goes two or three times a week just the same. Nearly everything he thinks, says and does he considers as sinful. He goes from church to church, from priest to priest, seeking peace of mind. Most of the priests will not allow him to make a general confession. How can Lester get over this nervousness? Should he make general confessions? Give a reason for your answer.
- After every confession, Hilda, 11 years of age, goes directly to the Communion railing, and there before Our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament she recites her penance. Then she tells Our Lord how thankful she is for His kindness and forgiveness. Before leaving the church, Hilda kneels before the image of Our Lady, asking her to help Hilda stay good. Tell us what you think of Hilda's custom after confession.
- Seumas had to confess a long list of mortal sins. He thinks the priest has given him too difficult a penance-the Stations of the Cross every day for a month. Afterwards, Seumas takes matters in his own hands and changes the penance to one decade of the Rosary each day for that month. Is Seumas allowed to do that? Explain your answer.
- Sinon thinks the priest gave him a penance of only three Hail Marys. But he isn't sure. A large number of penitents are awaiting their turn to go to confession. Sinon must hurry home to run an important errand for his mother. So he decides to say 5 Our Fathers and 5 Hail Marys as his penance. What have you to say about his decision?

## Lesson 33: Temporal Punishment and Indulgences `(Hình phạt tạm thời và Ân Xá)`

### Q. 435. What is an indulgence?

**A.** An indulgence is the remission granted by the Church of the temporal punishment due to sins already forgiven.

- An indulgence does not take away sin. Neither does it take away the eternal punishment due to mortal sins. An indulgence can produce its effects in the soul only after sins are forgiven and, in the case of mortal sins, only after their eternal punishment is taken away. Many who are not Catholic wrongly understand an indulgence to be a permission to commit sin, or a pardon for future sin, or a guarantee against temptation. By an indulgence the Church merely wipes out or lessens the temporal punishment due to sins already forgiven.
- The Church from the beginning has granted indulgences. Up to the sixth century indulgences generally took the form of a lessening of the public penances imposed for sins. In the early centuries it was customary for those who were to be martyred to ask that indulgences be granted to certain individuals.

> `"And I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven" (Matthew 16:19-20).`

> *`Also, read 2 Kings 24:1-25.`*

### Q. 436. How many kinds of indulgences are there?

**A.** There are two kinds of indulgences, plenary and partial.

### Q. 437. What is a plenary indulgence?

**A.** A plenary indulgence is the remission of all the temporal punishment due to our sins.

- A plenary indulgence is understood to be so granted that if a person should be unable to gain it fully, he will nevertheless gain it partially, in keeping with his disposition. A plenary indulgence, unless it is otherwise expressly stated, can be gained only once a day, even though the prescribed work is performed several times.
- The conditions ordinarily prescribed for gaining the plenary indulgence and designated by the familiar phrase, "under the usual conditions," are the following: confession, Communion, a visit to a church or public oratory, or even a semi-public oratory in certain cases, and prayer for the intentions of the Supreme Pontiff.
- The confession that may be required for gaining any particular indulgences may be made within the eight days which immediately precede the day to which the indulgences are appointed; the Communion may take place on the previous day; or both conditions may be satisfied on the day itself or within the following octave.
- The following are several examples of plenary indulgences that can be gained by all the faithful:
- Those who piously recite a third part of the Rosary (five decades) in the presence of the Blessed Sacrament, publicly exposed or even reserved in the tabernacle, may gain a plenary indulgence, on condition of confession and Communion (The Raccolta, No. 395, c).
- The faithful who, with at least a contrite heart, whether singly or in company, perform the pious exercises of the Way of the Cross, when the latter has been legitimately erected according to the prescriptions of the Holy See, may gain a plenary indulgence as often as they perform the same, and another plenary indulgence if they receive Holy Communion on the same day, or even within a month after having made the Stations ten times (The Raccolta, No. 194).
- The faithful who recite devoutly the prayer, "Behold, O good and sweetest Jesus" before an image of Jesus Christ Crucified, may gain a plenary indulgence under the usual conditions (The Raccolta, No. 201).

### Q. 438. What is a partial indulgence?

**A.** A partial indulgence is the remission of part of the temporal punishment due to our sins.

- A partial indulgence, unless the contrary is expressly stated, can be gained frequently throughout the day, whenever the prescribed work is repeated.
- To say that an indulgence of so many days or years is granted means that the amount of temporal punishment is remitted which, in the sight of God, would have been remitted by so many days or years of penance in the early Church. God alone knows exactly how much of the temporal punishment is actually taken away by an indulgence.
- The following are some ejaculations and invocations to which partial indulgences are attached:
- An indulgence of 500 days for saying the ejaculation: "Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of hosts: the heavens and the earth are full of Thy glory!" (The Raccolta, No. 2).
- An indulgence of 300 days for saying the ejaculation: "My God and my All!" (The Raccolta, No. 5).
- An indulgence of 500 days for saying the ejaculation: "O God, be merciful to me, the sinner" (The Raccolta, No. 14).
- An indulgence of 300 days; a plenary indulgence under the usual conditions, if this invocation is devoutly recited every day for a month: "My Jesus, mercy!" (The Raccolta, No. 70).
- An indulgence of 300 days; a plenary indulgence once a month under
- The usual conditions, for the daily repetition of: "O Sacrament most holy, O Sacrament divine! All praise and all thanksgiving be every moment Thine!" (The Raccolta, No. 136).
- (6) An indulgence of 300 days; a plenary indulgence once a month on the usual conditions, if this invocation is devoutly repeated daily: 'O Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us who have recourse to thee!" (The Raccolta, No. 357).

### Q. 439. How does the Church by means of indulgences remit the temporal punishment due to sin?

**A.** The Church by means of indulgences remits the temporal punishment due to sin by applying to us from her spiritual treasury part of the infinite satisfaction of Jesus Christ and of the superabundant satisfaction of the Blessed Virgin Mary and of the saints.

- In granting indulgences the Church exercises the power of the keys given to her by Christ. When the Church, by means of an indulgence, remits the temporal punishment due to sin, this action is ratified in heaven.

> `"But not like the offense is the gift. For if by the offense of the one the many died, much more has the grace of God, and the gift in the grace of the one man Jesus Christ, abounded unto the many. Nor is the gift as it was in the case of one man's sin, for the judgment was from one man unto condemnation, but grace is from many offenses unto justification. For if by reason of the one man's offense death reigned through the one man, much more will they who receive the abundance of the grace and of the gift of justice reign in life through the one Jesus Christ. Therefore as from the offense of the one man the result was unto condemnation to all men, so from the justice of the one the result is unto justification of life to all men. For just as by the disobedience of the one man the many were constituted sinners, so also by the obedience of the one the many will be constituted just. Now the Law intervened that the offense might abound. But where the offense has abounded, grace has abounded yet more; so that as sin has reigned unto death, so also grace may reign by justice unto life everlasting through Jesus Christ our Lord" (Romans 5:15-21).`

> `"For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, himself man, Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all, bearing witness in his own time" (1 Timothy 2:5-6).`

> `"But if anyone sins, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the just; and he is a propitiation for our sins, not for ours only but also for those of the whole world" (1 John 2:1-2).`

> *`See Scripture, question 435, Matthew 16:19-20.`*

### Q. 440. What is the superabundant satisfaction of the Blessed Virgin Mary and of the saints?

**A.** The superabundant satisfaction of the Blessed Virgin Mary and of the saints is that which they gained during their lifetime but did not need, and which the Church applies to their fellow members of the communion of saints.

### Q. 441. What must we do to gain an indulgence for ourselves?

**A.** To gain an indulgence for ourselves we must be in the state of grace, have at least a general intention of gaining the indulgence, and perform the works required by the Church.

- Only baptized persons are capable of gaining indulgences. The state of grace is required for gaining an indulgence at least at the moment when the prescribed work is finished. Even a person in mortal sin, therefore, can begin to gain an indulgence, unless the prescribed work demands the state of grace, for example, Holy Communion.
- Since a general intention is sufficient to gain indulgences, it is well to express from time to time, especially in our morning prayer, the desire to gain all the indulgences attached to the prayers we shall say and to the good works we shall perform.
- To gain an indulgence the work required by the Church must be performed fully and according to the prescribed time, place, and manner.

### Q. 442. Can we gain indulgences for others?

**A.** We cannot gain indulgences for other living persons, but we can gain them for the souls in purgatory, since the Church makes most indulgences applicable to them.

> `"Then they all blessed the just judgment of the Lord, who had discovered the things that were hidden. And so betaking themselves to prayers they besought him that the sin which had been committed might be forgotten. But the most valiant Judas exhorted the people to keep themselves from sin, forasmuch as they saw before their eyes what had happened because of the sins of those that were slain. "`

> `"And making a gathering, he sent twelve thousand drachms of silver to Jerusalem for sacrifice to be offered for the sins of the dead, thinking "well and religiously concerning the resurrection. "`

> `"(For if he had not hoped that they that were slain should rise again, it would have seemed superfluous and vain to pray for the dead.) "`

> `"And because he considered that they who had fallen asleep with godliness had great grace laid up for them. "It is therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead, that they may be loosed from sins. (2 Machabees 12:41-46).`

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT TEMPORAL PUNISHMENT AND INDULGENCES

- In the early days of the Church, it sometimes happened that a person was condemned to endure a severe penance; but if he went to a Christian friend who happened to be suffering for the faith in prison, and this friend interceded for the penitent with the bishop, offering his own sufferings for the benefit of the penitent, the bishop would accept them and grant absolution to the penitent. This was the first kind of indulgence granted by the Church. It differed in many details from the type of indulgence with which we are familiar today; but the principal feature of an indulgence was present-namely, the offering of the satisfactions of one member of the Church for another through the ministry of the Church. Down through the centuries the Church has continued to use this power of transferring the satisfactory value of the works of some of her members to others, to obtain the remission of temporal punishment owed to God, thus putting into practice the right conferred on the rulers of the Church by Christ Himself, who said to the apostles and their successors, the bishops: "Whatever you shall loose on earth, shall be loosed also in heaven" (Matthew, 18:18).
- The enemies of the Catholic Church ridicule the idea of indulgences, and claim that they induce people to sin more freely. They charge also that indulgences have often been sold for money. To this we reply that indulgences rather induce people to give up sin, because one must be free from mortal sin before he can gain an indulgence. Moreover, although there have been abuses in the past in the matter of indulgences, that is no objection to the proper use of them. Any sacred thing can be abused by wicked persons, but it does not on that account cease to be sacred and beneficial.
- Anyone who studies the Catholic doctrine of indulgences must admit that it is most reasonable. It simply means that God in His mercy will accept the satisfactory works of some members of the Church for the benefit of others. Even in human affairs this is a common practice. If one member of a family contracts a debt, and his brothers and sisters give him money to pay it, the creditor accepts the money and regards the debt as paid. God does the same when He accepts the satisfactions of His Divine Son and of the Saints in payment for the debt of temporal punishment due to other members of the Church.
- The satisfactory value of the good works performed by members of the Church who have no need of it themselves goes into the spiritual treasury of the Church, and it is then distributed by those who exercise jurisdiction in the Church, the Pope and the bishops. The Pope is not restricted as to the amount of indulgences he can grant, though even he must have a reason for granting an indulgence, since he is only the dispenser, not the owner of the Church's treasury. Nowadays a bishop can grant an indulgence of 100 days, an archbishop 200 days, a cardinal 300 days.
- Plenary indulgences are numerous, and the conditions are very easy. A plenary indulgence, unless it is otherwise expressly stated, can normally be gained only once a day, even though the prescribed work is performed several times. There are some exceptions however, in which one can even gain several plenary indulgences in a single day, by performing various works, each of which has a plenary indulgence attached to it; and even though each may demand confession and Communion, a person need receive these sacraments only once for all the indulgences he can gain in one day. Moreover, the Church allows us to gain many indulgences for the souls in purgatory. There is one indulgence especially which manifests the love of our Church for the faithful departed. It is the indulgence which can be gained on All Souls' Day, November 2nd; and it can be gained from noon of November 1st, until midnight of November 2nd. During this time a person who has been to confession and Communion can gain a plenary indulgence for the poor souls every time he visits a church or public oratory and recites six times the Our Father, the Hail Mary and the Glory be to the Father. This is a special exception to the ordinary law of the Church according to which a plenary indulgence for the same work can be gained only once a day.
- When one of the conditions for gaining an indulgence is a prayer for the intention of the Pope, it suffices to say once the Our Father, the Hail Mary and the Glory be to the Father, or some other equivalent prayer. But for a plenary indulgence that can be gained repeatedly on the same day by visiting a church and praying for the Holy Father, one must recite for each indulgence six times the Our Father, Hail Mary and Glory be to the Father.

- Illustrate the first type of indulgence granted by the Church in the early days of her history.
- What essential feature of indulgence is found in present day indulgences and in the type of indulgence found in the early Christian Church?
- Thomasine, a buyer in one of the big department stores, comes to the rescue of her brother Reginald who is heavily in debt. She pays his bills and thereby calls off his creditors. Explain why this example is a good illustration of the doctrine of indulgences.
- What is remarkable about the indulgence that may be gained for the Poor Souls around the beginning of November? Over what period of time may this indulgence be gained on that annual occurrence? How often may it be gained? How many Paters, Aves and Glorias must be said each time?
- Dorinda, a Jewess, Lucretia, a Catholic, and Jemimah, a Protestant all work in the same office. They are lunching together in a cafeteria opposite a Catholic church. On All Soul's Day they notice crowds of people entering and leaving the church, some of them reentering again immediately. Dorinda asks Lucretia what is going on. Lucretia explains that indulgences are being gained for the Poor Souls in Purgatory. Jemimah remarks: "Indulgences! Aren't they permissions to commit sin?" Dorinda says: "No; indulgences are acts that forgive sins, isn't that right, Lucretia?" What answer is Lucretia to make?
- Eamon and Constantine are arguing about the meaning of an indulgence of seven years. Eamon, mathematically inclined, figures out that the indulgence amounts to 2557 days, and claims that one's purgatory is shortened by that amount of time. Constantine says that is not the idea, but regretfully admits that he has forgotten what the real explanation is. What is the correct explanation?
- After Holy Communion, Natalia recites the crucifix prayer, "Behold, O kind and most sweet Jesus, etc." for the purpose of gaining a plenary indulgence. She is sorry for all her mortal sins, and for most of her venial sins. Does she gain the plenary indulgence? If not, does she gain any indulgence?
- Theodore is trying to gain a plenary indulgence. In praying for the Holy Father's intention, Theodore recites the "Confiteor" and the "Apostles' Creed." Does he fulfill that condition? Zaccheus, his brother, recites the of Faith, Hope, and Charity. Does he satisfy the requirement? Florence, their sister, says an Our Father, a Hail Mary, and a Glory be to the Father. Does she satisfy the demand? Explain.
- Myra, anxious to gain a certain plenary indulgence, performed all the requirements on September the 8th, Our Blessed Lady's birthday; but she did not go to Communion, the reception of which is required, for the gaining of the indulgence, until September 15th, the feast of Our Lady of Sorrows, the feast of her Seven Dolors. Did that delay prevent Myra from gaining the indulgence? Althea, her sister, performed all the requirements on September 24th, the Feast of Our Lady of Mercy. Did she fulfill the conditions for the plenary indulgence? Explain your answer.
- Leonore, on All Souls' day, makes seven visits to the parish church to gain plenary indulgences for her father and mother, her big brother Gregory and his wife Amabel, her little brother Edgar, herself, and the only deceased member of the family, her baby sister Nora who died two weeks after she was baptized. What is your comment about Leonore's understanding of these indulgences and their application?

- Fr. Gregory asked the children of the Sunday school if they had ever heard of the Heroic Act. Apparently nobody had ever heard of it, so Fr. Gregory explained that a person makes the Heroic Act when he gives the souls in purgatory all the indulgences he gains, and all the satisfactory value of his good works, including whatever may be applied to him after his death. Why is this act called heroic? Why do you think it is very pleasing to God?
- Every morning Seraphinus makes an offering of all the indulgences that he may gain in the course of the day for the poor souls in purgatory.

## Lesson 34: Extreme Unction and Holy Orders `(Xức Dầu Bệnh Nhân và Truyền Chức Thánh)`

### Q. 443. What is Extreme Unction?

**A.** Extreme Unction is the sacrament that, through the anointing with blessed oil by the priest and through his prayer, gives health and strength to the soul and sometimes to the body when we are in danger of death from sickness, accident, or old age.

- In administering Extreme Unction, the priest anoints the eyes, the ears, the nostrils, the lips, the hands, and, if convenient, the feet of the sick person. If the priest judges there is not sufficient time for multiple anointings, he can administer this sacrament by a single anointing on the forehead.
- While anointing the different senses the priest says the prayer: "Through this holy anointing, and His most tender mercy, may the Lord forgive you whatever sins you may have committed by sight" (by hearing, etc.).

> `"And going forth, they preached that men should repent, and they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many sick people, and healed them" (Mark 6:12-13).`

> `"Is any one among you sick? Let him bring in the presbyters of the Church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the sick man, and the Lord will raise him up, and if he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him" (James 5:14-15).`

### Q. 444. Who should receive Extreme Unction?

**A.** All Catholics who have reached the use of reason and are in danger of death from sickness, accident, or old age should receive Extreme Unction.

- A person does not actually have to be dying in order to receive Extreme Unction. Ordinarily, those who are in danger of death should be advised of their condition. It is false mercy to keep them ignorant of the fact that they may soon face God, their just Judge. Those who are in danger of death should welcome the sacrament of Extreme Unction. It cannot harm them, and it often helps them physically.

### Q. 445. What are the effects of the sacrament of Extreme Unction?

**A.** The effects of the sacrament of Extreme Unction are: first, an increase of sanctifying grace; second, comfort in sickness and strength against temptation; third, preparation for entrance into heaven by the remission of our venial sins and the cleansing of our souls from the remains of sin; fourth, health of body when it is good for the soul.

- The remains of sin cleansed by Extreme Unction are the spiritual weakness and indifference caused by original or actual sin.
- Extreme Unction does not always restore or improve the health of the body. Nor does Extreme Unction effect miraculous cures. But just as God produces spiritual effects through the sacraments, so He often produces the bodily effects of better health through Extreme Unction.

> *`See Scripture, question 443, James 5:14-15.`*

#### Extreme Unction

- *This picture shows a sick person to whom an Apostle is administering the sacrament of Extreme Unction. Above, an angel holds a banner with the words that St. wrote to the early Christians:*

> `"Is any one among you sick? Let him bring in the presbyters of the Church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord... . The Lord will raise him up, and if he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him." (St. James 5:14-15).`

- *Another angel points to heaven with his hand and holds a crown in the other.*

#### The Death of a Just Man and the Death of a Sinner

- *This picture shows the death of a just man and the death of a sinner. On top is the just man on his bed of agony, resigned and receiving the last consolations of religion. His guardian angel watches over him and encourages him. His relatives are praying for him. Jesus Christ and the Holy Virgin watch him from heaven and extend their arms towards him. The demon, full of rage and shame, flees to hell.*
- *At the bottom, the dying sinner refuses the priest with contempt. His guardian angel covers his face and departs in sorrow. Before leaving, the priest shows him the crucifix one more time. His relatives are full of dismay and dread. Jesus Christ appears to him and shows him the Cross on which He died to save him and before which He will judge him. The demons surround his bed and wait for the moment when he will breathe his last breath so they can take possession of his soul.*

### Q. 446. When does Extreme Unction take away mortal sin?

**A.** Extreme Unction takes away mortal sin when the sick person is unconscious or otherwise unaware that he is not properly disposed, but has made an act of imperfect contrition.

### Q. 447. How should we prepare ourselves to receive Extreme Unction?

**A.** We should prepare ourselves to receive Extreme Unction by a good confession, by acts of faith, hope, charity, and, especially, by resignation to the will of God.

> `"My son, in thy sickness, neglect not thyself: but pray to the Lord and he shall heal thee. Turn away from sin and order thy hands aright: and cleanse thy heart from all offense" (Ecclesiasticus 38:9-10).`

> *`Also, read Luke 22:41-42; and John 21:15-17.`*

### Q. 448. Who can administer Extreme Unction?

**A.** Only a priest can administer Extreme Unction.

### Q. 449. When is it advisable to call the priest to visit the sick?

**A.** It is advisable to call the priest to visit the sick in any serious illness, even though there is no apparent danger of death, as it is the duty of the priest to visit the sick and to administer to them the sacraments they need.

- The following preparations should be made in the home when the priest visits the sick to administer Holy Communion or the last sacraments: first, in the room of the sick person there should be a small table covered with a clean linen cloth. On the table there should be a crucifix, two blessed candles lighted, holy water, and a spoon; second, if the priest is bearing the Holy Eucharist, he should be met at the door with a lighted candle. The candle-bearer should genuflect and precede the priest to the sickroom, where all present should kneel. After the priest has sprinkled the room with holy water, if the sick person's confession is to be heard, all should leave the room and return and kneel when the confession is finished.

> *`See Scripture, question 443, James 5:14-15.`*

### Q. 450. In case of sudden or unexpected death, should a priest be called?

**A.** In case of sudden or unexpected death a priest should be called always, because absolution and Extreme Unction can be given conditionally for some time after apparent death.

- We are not certain of the moment when the soul leaves the body; the soul may remain united to the body for some time after apparent death. The sacraments of Penance and Extreme Unction can be administered conditionally for several hours after signs of life have ceased, because of the possibility that the soul may still be united with the body.

### Q. 451. What is Holy Orders?

**A.** Holy Orders is the sacrament through which men receive the power and grace to perform the sacred duties of bishops, priests, and other ministers of the Church.

- The distinction between clergy and laity is of divine origin, for first, Christ chose the twelve apostles from among His disciples; and in a special way deputed and consecrated them for the exercise of spiritual ministrations; and second, the apostles, who could not mistake the will of Christ, administered the sacrament of Holy Orders by consecrating bishops and by ordaining priests and deacons.
- A bishop is a priest who has received the fullness of Holy Orders, which gives him the power of administering the sacrament of Holy Orders, and makes him the ordinary minister of the sacrament of Confirmation.
- The other orders of ministers of the Church below those of priest are the major orders of deacon and subdeacon, and the four minor orders of acolyte, exorcist, lector or reader, and porter.
- Before a man receives Holy Orders he is constituted a member of the clerical state through the ceremony of tonsure in which hair is cut from his head in the form of a cross while he recites a verse from the to signify that he has dedicated himself to the service of God.
- A cardinal is a priest or bishop belonging to the group that has been especially selected to advise and assist the Pope in the government of the Church. Cardinals have the right of electing a new Pope after the death of the reigning Pontiff. Formerly even laymen were elevated to the cardinalate.
- An abbot is a priest who exercises over a religious community of men jurisdiction which is similar in some respects to that exercised by a bishop over his diocese.
- A vicar general is a priest appointed by a bishop to help him in the government of his diocese, and for this purpose he shares the bishop's power of jurisdiction.

> `"And having taken bread, he gave thanks and broke, and gave it to them, saying, 'This is my body, which is being given for you; do this in remembrance of me.' In like manner he took also the cup after the supper, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which shall be shed for you' " (Luke 22:19-20).`

> `"And the plan met the approval of the whole multitude, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicholas, a proselyte from Antioch. These they set before the apostles, and after they had prayed they laid their hands upon them" (Acts 6:5-6).`

> `"Take heed to yourselves and to the whole flock in which the Holy Spirit has placed you as bishops, to rule the Church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood" (Acts 20:28).`

> `"I commit to thee this charge, my son Timothy, that according to the prophecies once made concerning thee, thou mayest fight the good fight by means of them, having faith and a good conscience" (1 Timothy 1:18-19).`

> `"This saying is true: If anyone is eager for the office of bishops, he desires a good work. A bishop then, must be blameless, married but once, reserved, prudent, of good conduct, hospitable, a teacher, not a drinker or a brawler, but moderate, not quarrelsome, not avaricious. He should rule well his own household, keeping his children under control and perfectly respectful. For if a man cannot rule his own household, how is he to take care of the church of God? He must not be a new convert, lest he be puffed up with pride and incur the condemnation passed on the devil. Besides this he must have a good reputation with those who are outside, that he may not fall into disgrace and into a snare of the devil "Deacons also must be honorable, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy for base gain, but holding the mystery of faith in a pure conscience. And let them first be tried, and if found without reproach let them be allowed to serve. In like manner let the women be honorable, not slanderers, but reserved, faithful in all things. Deacons should be men who have been married but once, ruling well their children and their own households. And those who have fulfilled well this office will acquire a good position and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus" (1 Timothy 3:1-13).`

> `"Do not neglect the grace that is in thee, granted to thee by reason of prophecy with the laying on of hands of the presbyters. Meditate on these things; give thyself entirely to them, that thy progress may be manifest to all. Take heed to thyself and to thy teaching, be earnest in them. For in so doing thou wilt save both thyself and those who hear thee" (1 Timothy 4:14-16).`

> `"Let the presbyters who rule well be held worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching" (1 Timothy 5:17).`

> `"Do not lay hands hastily upon anyone, and do not be a partner in other men's sins" (1 Timothy 5:22).`

> `"For this reason I admonished thee to stir up the grace of God which is in thee by the laying on of my hands" (2 Timothy 1:6).`

> `"For this reason I left thee in Crete, that thou shouldst set right anything that is defective and shouldst appoint presbyters in every city, as I myself directed thee to do. They must be blameless, married but once, having believing children who are not accused of impurity or disobedience. For a bishop must be blameless as being the steward of God, not proud, or ill tempered, or a drinker, or a brawler, or greedy for base gain; but hospitable, gentle, reserved, just, holy, continent; holding fast the faithful word which is in accordance with the teaching, that he may be able both to exhort in sound doctrine and to confute opponents" (Titus 1:5-9).`

> `"For every high priest taken from among men is appointed for men in the things pertaining to God, that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. He is able to have compassion on the ignorant and erring, because he himself also is beset with weakness, and by reason thereof is obliged to offer for sins, as on behalf of the people, so also for himself. And no man takes the honor to himself; he takes it who is called by God, as Aaron was" (Hebrews 5:1-4).`

> `"For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices." (Hebrews 8:3).`

> `"Now I exhort the presbyters among you-I, your fellow-presbyter and witness of the sufferings of Christ, the partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed in time to come-tend the flock of God which is among you, governing not under constraint, but willingly, according to God; nor yet for the sake of base gain, but eagerly; nor yet as lording it over your charges, but becoming from the heart a pattern to the flock. And when the Prince of the shepherds appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.`

> `"Likewise, you who are younger, be subject to the presbyters. And all of you practice humility towards one another; for, 'God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble' " (1 Peter 5:1-5).`

### Q. 452. What are some of the requirements that a man may receive Holy Orders worthily?

**A.** That a man may receive Holy Orders worthily it is necessary: first, that he be in the state of grace and be of excellent character; second, that he have the prescribed age and learning; third, that he have the intention of devoting his life to the sacred ministry; fourth, that he be called to Holy Orders by his bishop.

- Some of the preliminary signs of a vocation to the priesthood are: first, that the boy or young man be capable of living habitually in the state of grace; second, that he be attracted to the priesthood and manifest this attraction by frequent confession and Communion, by a virtuous life, and by a love of serving Mass.
- Those who are called by God to be priests ordinarily receive no special revelation to this effect. God expects all to use the gifts of reason and of grace in determining their state of life.
- Without a special dispensation no one may be ordained a priest until he is twenty-four years of age. Ordinarily the prescribed learning consists of four years of high school, four years of college, and four years of theology completed in a seminary.
- The sacred ministry of the priesthood can be exercised either as a diocesan priest under a bishop, or as a member of a religious community under a religious superior. Priests of religious orders make the vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. Diocesan priests bind themselves to chastity for life and make a solemn promise of obedience to their bishop.

#### Holy Orders

- *The center of this picture shows St. Peter*
- *The power to carry out the ecclesiastical functions came from the Apostles to us by an uninterrupted succession of bishops that will continue until the end of time.*
- *The episcopacy is not an order; rather, it is the fullness of the priesthood. It confers upon those who receive it the power to administer all the sacraments, in particular Confirmation and Holy Orders. There are seven different orders in the Church: four minor orders and three major orders. The four minor orders are those of porter, lector, exorcist, and acolyte.*
- *The function of the porter is to open and to shut the doors of the church. At the top far left, a bishop is conferring the order of porter. He has the candidate touch the keys of the church while pronouncing the words which give him the custody of the keys.*
- *Immediately to the right, a bishop is conferring the order of lector, whose function is to read aloud the Old and New Testaments in the church. He has him touch the Missal while pronouncing the words which give him the power to read the word of God.*
- *In the third scene, a bishop is conferring the order of exorcist, whose function is to drive the demon from the bodies of the possessed. He has the candidate touch the book of exorcism, giving him the power to impose hands upon the possessed.*
- *In the right comer, a bishop is conferring the order of acolyte, whose function is to serve the sacred ministers at the altar. He has the candidate touch a candlestick and candle and then the empty cruets and gives him the power to light the candles of the church and to give the wine and water during the Mass.*
- *In the lower left corner, a bishop is conferring the order of subdeacon, whose functions are to serve the deacon at the altar and to sing the Epistle. He has the candidate touch the paten and the book of the Epistles, giving him the power to read it in the church. The sub-deacon is obliged to keep perpetual chastity and to recite the Divine Office every day.*
- *In the lower right comer, a bishop is conferring the order of deacon, whose functions are to serve the priest at Mass, to sing the Gospel, to preach, and to baptize. The bishop imposes his hands upon the candidate while saying, ''Receive the Holy Spirit that you may have the strength to resist the demon and his temptations."*
- *In the center of the lower panel, a bishop is ordaining priests. A priest's function is to say the Holy Mass, to preach, and to administer the sacraments. The bishop imposes his hands upon each candidate, as do all the priests who are present, anoints his hands with Holy Oil, has him touch a chalice containing some wine, and touch a paten with a host. At the same time, the bishop says to him, "Receive the power to offer sacrifice to God and to celebrate the Mass for the living and the dead."*

### Q. 453. What are the effects of ordination to the priesthood?

**A.** The effects of ordination to the priesthood are: first, an increase of sanctifying grace; second, sacramental grace, through which the priest has God's constant help in his sacred ministry; third, a character, lasting forever, which is a special sharing in the priesthood of Christ and which gives the priest special supernatural powers.

> `"The Lord hath sworn, and he will not repent: 'Thou art a priest forever according to the order of Melchisedech' " (Psalm 109:4).`

> `"On behalf of Christ, therefore, we are acting as ambassadors, God, as it were, appealing through us" (2 Corinthians 5:20).`

> *`See Scripture, question 451, Luke 22:19-20; Titus 1:5-9; and Hebrews 5:1-4.`*

### Q. 454. What are the chief supernatural powers of the priest?

**A.** The chief supernatural powers of the priest are: to change bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, and to forgive sins in the sacrament of Penance.

> `"He therefore said to them again, 'Peace be to you! As the Father has sent me, I also send you.' When he had said this, he breathed upon them, and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit; whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained' " (John 20:21-23).`

> *`See Scripture, question 451, Luke 22:19-20.`*

### Q. 455. Why should Catholics show reverence and honor to the priest?

**A.** Catholics should show reverence and honor to the priest because he is the representative of Christ Himself and the dispenser of His mysteries.

- In showing reverence and honor to the priest one shows reverence and honor to Christ Himself, for the priest in a very true sense is "another Christ." In this country it is the custom to honor priests by addressing them with the title "Father." The custom of tipping the hat to the priest is praiseworthy. The proper way to address a bishop and an archbishop is "Your Excellency;" a cardinal, "Your Eminence." The Pope is addressed as "Your Holiness."

> `"With all thy soul fear the Lord, and reverence his priests" (Ecclesiasticus 7:31).`

> `"Pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send forth laborers into his harvest" (Matthew 9:38).`

> `"He who receives you, receives me; and he who receives me, receives him who sent me" (Matthew 10:40).`

> `"And Jesus drew near and spoke to them saying, 'All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and behold, I am with you all days, even unto the consummation of the world' " (Matthew 28:18-20).`

> `"He who hears you, hears me; and he who rejects you, rejects me; and he who rejects me, rejects him who sent me" (Luke 10:16).`

> `"You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and have appointed you that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain" (John 15:16).`

> `"Now I exhort you, brethren, through our Lord Jesus Christ, and through the charity of the Spirit, that you help me by your prayers to God for me" (Romans 15:30).`

> `"Let a man so account us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God" (1 Corinthians 4:1).`

> `"On the contrary, let us conduct ourselves in all circumstances as God's ministers, in much patience; in tribulations, in hardships, in distresses; in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults; in labors, in sleepless nights, in fastings; in innocence, in knowledge, in long-sufferings; in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in unaffected love; in the word of truth, in the power of God; with the armor of justice on the right hand and on the left; in honor and dishonor, in evil report and good report; as deceivers and yet truthful, as unknown and yet well known, as dying and behold, we live, as chastised but not killed, as sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor yet enriching many, as having nothing yet possessing all things" (2 Corinthians 6:4-10).`

> `"Obey your superiors and be subject to them, for they keep watch as having to render an account of your souls; so that they may do this with joy, and not with grief, for that would not be expedient for you" (Hebrews 13:17).`

### Q. 456. Who is the minister of the sacrament of Holy Orders?

**A.** The bishop is the minister of the sacrament of Holy Orders.

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT EXTREME UNCTION AND HOLY ORDERS

- There is no occasion in life when a person stands more in need of God's assistance and consolation than when his soul is about to take its flight into eternity. Remorse for the past, fear of what may lie before him, the last efforts of the devil to lead him into sin combine with his bodily weakness and pain to make those last hours on earth a time of dreadful anguish. Considering the tender mercy of Our Saviour, we should expect that He would have established a special means of aiding the souls of His faithful followers in that dread hour. Our holy faith tells us that Christ did this, by instituting the sacrament of Extreme Unction for those who are in danger of death from sickness or accident or even old age. There is no reference in the Gospel to the establishment of such a sacrament by Our Lord, though one may say that it was foreshadowed in the anointing of the sick by the apostles in the course of Christ's ministry (Mark, 6: 13). However, St. speaks plainly of this sacrament, saying: "Is any one among you sick? Let him bring in the presbyters of the Church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the sick man, and the Lord will raise him up, and if he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him" (James: 5:14, 15).
- This sacrament is called "Unction" because it is conferred through the anointing or unction of the sick person; it is called "Extreme" or "Last" because it is usually given toward the end of a person's life, and also because it is the last of several unctions that the Christian receives in the course of his life, since he previously received anointings in Baptism and Confirmation, and, if he is a priest or a bishop, at Ordination.
- This sacrament is intended to comfort the soul in the distress that normally accompanies weakened bodily powers; hence, it can be given only to one who is in danger of death from some cause actually afflicting his body. It cannot be given to one in danger of death from some cause that has not yet brought about serious bodily weakness-for example, to a soldier on his way to a dangerous battle or to a criminal about to be executed. From this standpoint Extreme Unction differs from the Holy Eucharist as Viaticum which is intended for everyone in danger of death, whatever may be the cause.
- The sacrament of Extreme Unction, worthily received, confers noticeable strength of soul and courage on the sick person, so much so that even non-Catholics are astonished at the beneficial effects of this sacrament on the sick. Sometimes it produces restoration to bodily health; however, this effect can be expected only if the sacrament is given before the person comes so near to death that nothing but a miracle can save him. Therefore, Catholics should be glad to receive Extreme Unction whenever there is any danger of death from sickness or accident or old age; above all, they should rid themselves of the erroneous notion that once a person has received the last sacraments he is sure to die. Moreover, in every Catholic household there should be available all that is necessary for the ceremonies of the last sacraments-particularly, two blessed wax candles, a crucifix, holy water, and some cotton.
- The sacrament of Holy Orders is mentioned in the Sacred Scriptures, especially in the Epistles of St. Paul to Timothy, in which the apostle refers to the ceremony by which he communicated the priestly power to Timothy: "I admonish thee to stir up the grace of God which is in thee by the laying on of my hands" (II Timothy, 1: 6). Down through the centuries this ceremony has been used to transmit the powers that Our Lord gave to His apostles, to make men priests and bishops. The ceremony of ordination nowadays is more elaborate than in the early Church, yet the rites of laying-on of hands has always been used. We now know with certainty, by reason of a declaration of Pope Pius XII, that the ceremony by which the power and the grace of the orders of deacon, priest and bishop are conferred, is the imposition of the bishop's hands with the prayers that immediately follow. And so, the priests and bishops of today have received their supernatural powers from an unbroken chain of ordination ceremonies going back to the apostles, who received them from Christ Himself.
- It is truly a wonderful privilege to be a priest; and any Catholic boy or young man who thinks that he has the qualifications for this sacred calling and a desire to serve God in this ministry should pray fervently that God may guide him aright in his choice of a state of life, and lead him to the priesthood if it be His holy will. However, no one should enter the priesthood for any human motive-for example to please his parents- but only out of the highest motive, to sanctify his own soul and to work faithfully for the spread of God's kingdom on earth.

## Lesson 35: Matrimony `(Bí tích Hôn Phối)`

### Q. 457. What is the sacrament of matrimony?

**A.** Matrimony is the sacrament by which a baptized man and a baptized woman bind themselves for life in a lawful marriage and receive the grace to discharge their duties.

- Though unbaptized persons can be truly married, only baptized persons can be united in the sacrament of Matrimony and receive the graces of this sacrament.
- God instituted marriage when He made Eve as a helpmate for Adam in the Garden of Eden. We know from the constant tradition of the Church that marriage was made a sacrament by Our Lord sometime during His life on earth.
- The outward sign in the sacrament of Matrimony is the external expression by the man and woman of their mutual consent to give themselves to each other as husband and wife. The sacrament of Matrimony is administered by the contracting parties, each of whom confers the sacrament on the other.

> `"And God created man to his own image; to the image of God he created him. Male and female he created them. And God blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the earth" (Genesis 1:27-28).`

> `"And the Lord God said: It is not good for man to be alone; let us make him a help like unto himself. "`

> `"And the Lord God having formed out of the ground all the beasts of the earth, and all the fowls of the air, brought them to Adam to see what he would call them: for whatsoever Adam called any living creature the same is its name. "`

> `"And Adam called all the beasts by their names, and all the fowls of the air, and all the cattle of the field: but for Adam there was not found a helper like himself. "`

> `"Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep upon Adam: and when he was fast asleep, he took one of his ribs, and filled up flesh for it. "And the Lord God built the rib which he took from Adam into a woman: and brought her to Adam. "`

> `"And Adam said: This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man. "`

> `"Wherefore a man shall leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they shall be two in one flesh" (Genesis 2:18-24).`

> `"It was said, moreover, 'Whoever puts away his wife, let him give her a written notice of dismissal.' But I say to you that everyone who puts away his wife, save on account of immorality, causes her to commit adultery; and he who marries a woman who has been put away commits adultery" (Matthew 5:31-32).`

> `"And there came to him some Pharisees, testing him, and saying, 'Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for any cause?' But he answered and said to them, 'Have you not read that the Creator, from the beginning, made them male and female, and said, "For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh?" Therefore now they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let no man put asunder.' They said to him, 'Why then did Moses command to give a written notice of dismissal, and to put her away?' He said to them, 'Because Moses, by reason of the hardness of your heart, permitted you to put away your wives; but it was not so from the beginning. And I say to you, that whoever puts away his wife, except for immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries a woman who has been put away commits adultery.' " (Matthew 19:3-9).`

> `"Now concerning the things whereof you wrote to me: It is good for man not to touch woman. Yet, for fear of fornication, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband. Let the husband render to the wife her due, and likewise the wife to the husband. The wife has not authority over her body, but the husband; the husband likewise has not authority over his body, but the wife. Do not deprive each other, except perhaps by consent, for a time that you may give yourselves to prayer; and return together again lest Satan tempt you because you lack self-control. But this I say by way of concession, not by way of commandment. For I would that you all were as I am myself; but each one has his own gift from God, one in this way, and another in that" (1 Corinthians 7:1-7).`

> *`See also John 2:1-10. Our Lord, by attending the marriage feast at Cana and working His first miracle for the benefit of the bride and groom, thereby sanctified the married state.`*

### Q. 458. What is the chief duty of husband and wife in the married state?

**A.** The chief duty of husband and wife in the married state is to be faithful to each other, and to provide in every way for the welfare of the children God may give them.

- The duty of being faithful to each other means that the privileges of husband and wife may be shared by them alone.
- Parents by the will of God have the primary right and obligation to feed, clothe, shelter, and educate their children. This God-given right may not be unjustly interfered with by any power on earth. Any law that takes away or lessens this right and obligation is unjust.

> `"Take heed to keep thyself, my son, from all fornication: and beside thy wife never endure to know a crime" (Tobias 4:13).`

> `"He that loveth his son frequently chastiseth him: that he may rejoice in his latter end and not grope after the doors of his neighbors. "`

> `"He that instructeth his son shall be praised in him and shall glory in him in the midst of them of his household. "`

> `"He that teacheth his son maketh his enemy jealous: and in the midst of his friends he shall glory in him. "`

> `"His father is dead, and he is as if he were not dead: for he hath left one behind that is like himself. "`

> `"While he lived, he saw and rejoiced in him: and when he died, he was not sorrowful, neither was he confounded before his enemies. "`

> `"For he left behind him a defender of his house against his enemies, and one that will requite kindness to his friends. "`

> `"For the souls of his sons he shall bind up his wounds: and at every cry his bowels shall be troubled. "`

> `"A horse not broken becometh stubborn: and a child left to himself will become headstrong. "`

> `"Give thy son his way, and he shall make thee afraid: play with him, and he shall make thee sorrowful. "`

> `"Laugh not with him: lest thou have sorrow, and at the last thy teeth be set on edge. "`

> `"Give him not liberty in his youth: and wink not at his devices. "`

> `"Bow down his neck while he is young, and beat his sides while he is a child: lest he grow stubborn, and regard thee not, and so be a sorrow of heart to thee. "`

> `"Instruct thy son, and labor about him: lest his lewd behavior be an offense to thee" (Ecclesiasticus 30:1-13).`

> `"You have heard that it was said to the ancients, 'Thou shalt not commit adultery.' But I say to you that anyone who so much as looks with lust at a woman has already committed adultery with her in his heart" (Matthew 5:27-28).`

> `"Be subject to one another in the fear of Christ. Let wives be subject to their husbands as to the Lord; because a husband is head of the wife, just as Christ is head of the Church, being himself savior of the body. But just as the Church is subject to Christ, so also let wives be to their husbands in all things.`

> `"Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the Church, and delivered himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, cleansing her in the bath of water by means of the word; in order that he might present to himself the Church in all her glory, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she might be holy and without blemish. Even thus ought husbands also to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife, loves himself. For no one ever hated his own flesh; on the contrary he nourishes and cherishes it; as Christ also does the Church (because we are members of his body, made from his flesh and from his bones).`

> `'For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh.'`

> `"This is a great mystery-I mean in reference to Christ and to the Church. However, let each one of you also love his wife just as he loves himself; and let the wife respect her husband" (Ephesians 5:21-33).`

> `"And you, fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but rear them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord" (Ephesians 6:4).`

> `"Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is becoming in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives and do not be bitter towards them" (Colossians 3:18-19).`

### Q. 459. Why does the bond of the sacrament of Matrimony last until the death of husband or wife?

**A.** The bond of the sacrament of Matrimony lasts until the death of husband or wife because Christ has said: "What therefore God has joined together, let no man put asunder."

- Once a man and woman are completely united in the sacrament of Matrimony, they remain truly husband and wife until the death of either of them. A separation, a divorce, or an attempted marriage with another person does not destroy the marriage bond.
- It is for the good of husband and wife, for the bodily and spiritual welfare of their children, and for the good of society that God has decreed that the marriage bond can be broken only by death.

> `"Do you not know, brethren (for I speak to those who know law), that the Law has dominion over a man as long as he lives? For the married woman is bound by the Law while her husband is alive; but if her husband die, she is set free from the law of her husband. Therefore while her husband is alive, she will be called an adulteress if she be with another man; but if her husband dies, she is set free from the law of the husband, so that she is not an adulteress if she has been with another man" (Romans 7:1-3).`

> `"But I say to the unmarried and to widows, it is good for them if they so remain, even as I. But if they do not have self-control, let them marry, for it is better to marry than to burn. But to those who are married, not I, but the Lord commands that a wife is not to depart from her husband, and if she departs, that she is to remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And let not a husband put away his wife.`

> `"To the others I say, not the Lord: If any brother has an unbelieving wife and she consents to live with him, let him not put her away. And if any woman has an unbelieving husband and he consents to live with her, let her not put away her husband. For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing husband; otherwise your children would be unclean, but, as it is, they are holy. But if the unbeliever departs, let him depart. For a brother or sister is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us to peace" (1 Corinthians 7:8-15).`

> `"A woman is bound as long as her husband is alive, but if her husband dies, she is free. Let her marry whom she pleases, only let it be in the Lord. But she will be more blessed, in my judgment, if she remains as she is.`

> `And I think that I also have the spirit of God" (1 Corinthians 7:39-40).`

### Q. 460. What is meant by the unity of the sacrament of Matrimony?

**A.** By the unity of the sacrament of Matrimony is meant that the husband cannot during the life of his wife have another wife, nor the wife during the life of her husband have another husband.

- Because of the unity of the sacrament of Matrimony, any other sexual union during the life of either party is adultery. Laws that permit remarriage during the life of husband or wife are contrary to God's laws. Even though civil law may permit remarriage, such a marriage is sinful and not really a marriage at all, but rather an adulterous union.

### Q. 461. Why is every true marriage between a baptized man and a baptized woman a sacrament?

**A.** Every true marriage between a baptized man and a baptized woman is a sacrament because Christ Himself raised every marriage of this kind to the dignity of a sacrament.

- Marriage by its nature is a contract. Marriage between baptized persons is a sacramental contract, that is, a contract that is also a sacrament.

> *`See Scripture, question 457, Matthew 19:3-9.`*

### Q. 462. Why has the Catholic Church alone the right to make laws regulating the marriages of baptized persons?

**A.** The Catholic Church alone has the right to make laws regulating the marriages of baptized persons because the Church alone has authority over the sacraments and over sacred matters affecting baptized persons.

- Although the Catholic Church has the right to make laws regarding the marriages of all baptized persons, the Church does not in all cases bind baptized non-Catholics by these laws. Non-Catholics are bound by the laws when, for example, they marry Catholics.

> `"For what have I to do with judging those outside? ... For those outside God will judge" (1 Corinthians 5:12-13).`

> *`See Scripture, question 137, Matthew 16:18; Matthew 28:18-20; also question 459, 1 Corinthians 7:8-15.`*

### Q. 463. What authority has the State regarding the marriages of baptized persons?

**A.** Regarding the marriages of baptized persons, the State has the authority to make laws concerning their effects that are merely civil.

- By the civil effects of matrimony are meant the rights and obligations of husband and wife as citizens: for example, the right to a share in the property of the other.

> `"Then he said to them, 'Render, therefore, to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's' " (Matthew 22:2l).`

### Q. 464. What is necessary to receive the sacrament of Matrimony worthily?

**A.** To receive the sacrament of Matrimony worthily it is necessary to be in the state of grace, to know the duties of married life, and to obey the marriage laws of the Church.

- Matrimony is a sacrament of the living; therefore one must be in the state of grace to receive the grace of this sacrament. Even though one is not in the state of grace, a true marriage nevertheless is contracted. He who receives this sacrament in the state of mortal sin commits a mortal sin of sacrilege. It is customary for those who are to be married to go to confession shortly before the ceremony.

> `"For we are the children of saints; and we must not be joined together like heathens that know not God" (Tobias 8:5).`

> *`See Scripture, question 457, Genesis 2:18-24; Matthew 19:3-9; also question 458, Ecclesiasticus 30:1-13; Ephesians 5:21-33 and Ephesians 6:4.`*

### Q. 465. In whose presence do the laws of the Church require a Catholic to be married?

**A.** The laws of the Church require a Catholic to be married in the presence of the parish priest, or the bishop of the diocese, or a priest delegated by either of them, and before two witnesses.

- The marriage of a Catholic before a minister or a civil official, such as a judge, a justice of the peace, a squire, or any clerk of court, is not really a marriage. Catholics who live together after such a marriage are living in sin just as much as if they had never gone through such a ceremony. Catholics who attempt marriage in this fashion commit a mortal sin and incur other punishments of the Church.

#### Matrimony

- *In the center, St. Joseph is espousing the Holy Virgin in the presence of the high priest in the temple of Jerusalem. The flowering lily that St. Joseph is holding in his hand recalls the manner in which he was chosen to be the spouse of the Holy Virgin. When the Blessed Virgin Mary was old enough to be married, the high priest gathered the young men of the house of David who wished to marry her and gave to each one of them a blessed branch, ordering them to carve their names upon them. Then he put all the branches on the altar and prayed to the Lord to manifest His choice. When he took the branches from the altar, Joseph's alone was covered with leaves and a white flower similar to a lily. On the right is a young man who, upset at not having been chosen, breaks the branch that he received from the high priest.*
- *At the top left, the young and Sara prepare themselves for marriage by fervent prayers. The angel Raphael is driving away a demon who had killed Sara's first seven husbands because of the bad dispositions with which they had entered marriage with her. The resolution that and Sara made to serve God in marriage obtained for them the protection of the angel.*
- *At the bottom, two Catholics are marrying in the presence of a priest. Above, on the right, is Adam, with Eve, whom God formed from one of Adam's ribs. God is blessing them, saying:*

> `"Be fruitful and multiply." (Genesis 1:28).`

### Q. 466. What are the chief effects of the sacrament of Matrimony?

**A.** The chief effects of the sacrament of Matrimony are: first, an increase of sanctifying grace; second, the special help of God for husband and wife to love each other faithfully, to bear with each other's faults, and to bring up their children properly.

### Q. 467. What should Catholics do to prepare for a holy and happy marriage?

**A.** To prepare for a holy and happy marriage, Catholics should: first, pray that God may direct their choice; second, seek the advice of their parents and confessors; third, practice the virtues, especially chastity; fourth, frequently receive the sacraments of Penance and Holy Eucharist.

- Sinful and unhappy marriages frequently result from the company keeping of Catholics with non-Catholics. Keeping company with those who, because of previous marriage or who for any other reason are not free to marry Catholics, ordinarily is a mortal sin.
- Catholics who are eligible and who intend to marry should keep company only with Catholics. The advice of parents and confessors should be sought, for they, more than anyone else, are interested in the welfare of those who intend to marry.
- Close association with those of the other sex causes many temptations. Those who are keeping company must be especially diligent in the practice of the virtues, especially chastity, which will lessen the danger of committing sin. Those who intend to marry will find in the sacraments of Penance and Holy Eucharist the most fruitful source of grace necessary to prepare themselves for a holy and happy marriage.

> `"O how beautiful is the chaste generation with glory, for the memory thereof is immortal: because it is known both with God and with men" (Wisdom 4:1).`

> `"Or do you not know that your members are the temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own? For you have been bought at a great price. Glorify God and bear him in your body" (1 Corinthians 6:19-20).`

### Q. 468. How can Catholics best obtain God's blessing for their marriage?

**A.** Catholics can best obtain God's blessing for their marriage by being married at a Nuptial Mass and by receiving Holy Communion devoutly.

- In a Nuptial Mass special blessings are asked for the bride and groom. When Catholics are not married at a Nuptial Mass they should arrange to receive the nuptial blessing at a later date. Catholics who for any reason cannot be married at Mass should receive Holy Communion on the morning of the wedding day.

> `For we are the children of saints: and we must not be joined together like heathens that know not God. "So they both arose, and prayed earnestly both together that health might be given them.`

> `"And said: Lord God of our fathers, may the heavens and the earth, and the sea, and the fountains, and the rivers, and all thy creatures that are in them, bless thee. "`

> `"Thou madest Adam of the slime of the earth: and gavest him Eve for his helper. "`

> `"And now, Lord, thou knowest, that not for fleshly lust do I take my sister to wife, but only for the love of posterity, in which thy name may be blessed forever and ever. "`

> `"Sara also said: Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us: and let us grow old both together in health" (Tobias 8:5-10).`

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT MATRIMONY

- Since marriage is one of the most important institutions in human life, it is most natural that Our Lord should have established a special sacrament for married couples. Our Catholic faith teaches us that Christ did so, making the marriage contract of baptized persons the sacrament of Matrimony. Accordingly, whenever two baptized persons are married, they receive this sacrament at the very moment when they make the marriage contract, whether or not they realize that it is a sacrament.
- The end to which marriage is primarily directed is that children be brought into the world and properly reared for happiness in this life and in the next. Hence, when a married couple make use of their right to sexual union but perform the act in such a way that the conception of children is positively frustrated, they are guilty of a grave sin. This sin, known as contraception or birth control, is very common nowadays. It was severely condemned by Pope Pius XI in his Encyclical on Christian Marriage. Other purposes of marriage are the love and assistance that husband and wife mutually give and the opportunity of satisfying reasonably and lawfully the inclination to sexual gratification, which is so strong an impulse in human nature.
- Just when Our Lord made Christian marriage a sacrament is not clear from Sacred Scripture; but from a text of St. Paul, we can infer that Christ did raise marriage to this dignity. Writing to the Ephesians, St. Paul says that the union between a Christian husband and wife is a sign or symbol of the union between Christ and the Church (Ephesians, 5, 21-33). From this principle we argue that since the union between Christ and the Church is a supernatural union that produces grace, the union between husband and wife must also be a supernatural union giving grace to the couple- in other words, a sacrament. This doctrine is not indeed clearly stated by St. Paul, but our inference is fully confirmed by the tradition of the Church, which has always regarded marriage as one of the divine means of grace, especially blessed by Our Saviour, intended to aid Christian husbands and wives to be faithful to God and to each other, and to perform exactly all the duties of their state of life.
- Since Christian marriage is a sacrament, the Church possesses jurisdiction over the marriages of all baptized persons. The Church uses this authority especially by laying down marriage impediments-that is, by ruling that certain couples may not marry because of a prohibition arising either from the law of God or from the law of the Church. If a couple, bound by an impediment, attempted marriage without a dispensation from the Church, the marriage would be sinful though valid, supposing that the impediment was an impeding impediment, and both sinful and invalid, supposing that the impediment was a diriment impediment. The Church can give a dispensation from an impediment established by ecclesiastical law, but not from an impediment established by divine law.
- The fact that a person has taken a private vow of chastity is an impeding impediment; the bond of an already existing marriage is a diriment impediment by divine law; the blood relationship between first and second cousins is a diriment impediment by ecclesiastical law.
- Nowadays the state of marriage is degraded by many persons. They enter marriage hastily, with little thought of its sacred dignity, and with small regard for its obligations. After a few years they tire of each other, obtain a divorce and marry again. Sad to say, even some Catholics have not the proper concept of marriage, and though they may not go so far as to seek divorce, they try to rid themselves of the burdens of the married state, and selfishly refuse to live up to the obligations of this state, as God has established it. That is the reason for unhappiness in some Catholic homes.
- It is the teaching of the Catholic Church that the marriage of two baptized persons, once they have used their right of sexual union, can never be dissolved except by the death of one of the parties. This rule holds for the marriage of baptized non-Catholics as well as for that of Catholics. In other types of marriage, the bond can sometimes be broken with the consent or authority of the Church. There are three types of such marriages, which can be dissolved in exceptional circumstances: (1) if at the time of the marriage both of the parties were unbaptized, and later one receives Baptism and the other refuses to dwell peacefully and sinlessly with the convert. This is called the Pauline privilege. (2) If at the time of the marriage one was a baptized non-Catholic and the other an unbaptized person; (3) if at the time of the marriage both were baptized persons, but they never had sexual relations as husband and wife. Furthermore, sometimes the Church allows a husband and wife to separate or live apart, without having any right to remarry.
- Before the marriage of a Catholic couple the law of the Church calls for the publication of the banns-announcements of the coming marriage-to be made in the parish of each of the parties on three Sundays or feast days. Then, if anyone believes that they should not marry because of some impediment or other grave reason he should at once inform the authorities of the Church. Those intending to marry should make arrangements with one of the priests in the parish of the intended bride (where the ceremony should ordinarily take place) at least a month before the date of the marriage.
- In a Catholic home where the husband and wife live according to the Christian ideals as proposed by the Catholic Church there is true contentment and happiness, even though material comforts and luxuries may be lacking. They bring up their children religiously, with the realization that God has sent them these little ones to be trained in His love and to become one day citizens of heaven. Such a Catholic home is truly an image of the home of Nazareth, in which dwelt the three holiest persons that ever lived on earth-the Holy Family, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

### RESOLUTION

- Pray every day for your parents. If they are alive, ask God to help them to live up to their obligations of the holy state of Matrimony; if they are dead, pray that they may soon be admitted to the kingdom of heaven.

## Lesson 36: The Sacramentals `(Các Á Bí Tích)`

### Q. 469. What are sacramentals?

**A.** Sacramentals are holy things or actions of which the Church makes use to obtain spiritual and temporal favors for us from God, through the Church's' intercession.

- These holy things and actions are called sacramentals because they resemble the sacraments in some ways. Only Christ could institute the sacraments; the Church has instituted most of the sacramentals.
- The sacraments are signs which contain the sanctifying and sacramental grace they signify; the sacramentals are signs but do not contain the graces they signify. The sacraments have within themselves the power to give grace to those who receive them with the right dispositions; the sacramentals do not have within themselves this power.

> `"And they marched from mount Hor, by the way that leadeth to the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom. And the people began to be weary of their journey and labor: "`

> `"And speaking against God and Moses, they said: Why didst thou bring us out of Egypt, to die in the wilderness? There is no bread, nor have we any waters: our soul now loatheth this very light food. "`

> `"Wherefore the Lord sent among the people fiery serpents, which bit them and killed many of them. "`

> `"Upon which they came to Moses, and said: We have sinned, because we have spoken against the Lord and thee. Pray that he may take away these serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people. "`

> `And the Lord said to him: "Make a brazen serpent, and set it up for a sign. Whosoever being struck shall look on it shall live. "`

> `"Moses therefore made a brazen serpent, and set it up for a sign: which when they that were bitten looked upon, they were healed" (Numbers 21:4-9).`

> `"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that those who believe in him may not perish, but may have life everlasting" (John 3:14-15).`

> `See Numbers 19:1-22. In this passage God directed the Israelites to use material objects, i.e., ashes, and water of purification in the worship of the Old Law.`

### Q. 470. How do the sacramentals obtain favors from God?

**A.** The sacramentals obtain favors from God through the prayers of the Church offered for those who make use of them, and through the devotion they inspire.

> *`See Scripture, question 469. Numbers 21:4-9.`*

### Q. 471. What are the chief benefits obtained by the use of the sacramentals?

**A.** The chief benefits obtained by the use of the sacramentals are: first, actual graces; second, the forgiveness of venial sins; third, the remission of temporal punishment; fourth, health of body and material blessings; fifth, protection from evil spirits.

### Q. 472. Which are the chief kinds of sacramentals?

**A.** The chief kinds of sacramentals are: first, blessings given by priests and bishops; second, exorcisms against evil spirits; third, blessed objects of devotion.

- Some of the blessings given by priests and bishops are: the blessings of churches, of the sacred vessels and vestments, of the sick, of houses, of crops, of palms, of ashes, and of holy water.
- Christ Himself cast out many evil spirits. He also gave His apostles power and authority over all the devils (Luke 9:1) and declared that "... in my name they shall cast out devils" (Mark 16:17).

> `"And they came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gerasenes; and as soon as he stepped out of the boat, there met him from the tombs a man with an unclean spirit. This man lived in the tombs and no one could any longer bind him, even with chains; for often he had been bound with fetters and chains, and he had rent the chains asunder and broken the fetters into pieces. And no one was able to control him. And constantly, night and day, he was in the tombs and on the mountains, howling and gashing himself with stones. "`

> `"And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and worshipped him, and crying out with a loud voice, he said, 'What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of the highest God? I adjure thee by God, do not torment me!' For he was saying to him, 'Go out of the man, thou unclean spirit.' "`

> `"And he asked him, 'What is thy name?' And he said to him, 'My name is Legion, for we are many!' And he entreated him earnestly not to drive them out of the country. "`

> `"Now a great herd of swine was there on the mountainside, feeding. And the spirits kept entreating him, saying, 'Send us into the swine that we may enter into them!' And Jesus immediately gave them leave. And the unclean spirits came out and entered into the swine; and the herd, in number about two thousand, rushed down with great violence into the sea, and were drowned in the sea" (Mark 5:1-3).`

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT THE SACRAMENTALS

- The word "sacramental" means something connected with a sacrament. When this word was first used it meant the ceremonies that the Church uses in connection with the administration of the sacraments, such as the anointing with oil in Baptism. Later it acquired the meaning of objects blessed by the Church or blessings or exorcisms against the evil spirits, and this is the meaning it has today. The Church is authorized to institute sacramentals because they are useful means toward bringing men to eternal life. We are creatures largely dependent on the use of our senses. Our Blessed Lord established the sacraments as signs appealing to the senses; in establishing the sacramentals, the Church is imitating Him. Of course, there is a vast difference between the sacraments and the sacramentals, inasmuch as the sacraments are instruments of divine power, able of themselves to give grace; whereas the sacramentals inspire to pious sentiments those who use them properly. By means of these pious sentiments they receive grace; the sacramentals also bring to their users the benefit of the Church's prayers. Every day throughout the world millions of Catholics, both the clergy and the laity, unite in prayer to the Almighty. The benefit of these prayers is given to those who devoutly use the sacramentals.
- There are many sacramentals. Especially numerous are the blessings given by the clergy of the Church. There are two kinds of blessings, known respectively as constitutive and invocative blessings. The former render a person or object sacred. Such, for example, is the solemn blessing given to a priest when he is made an abbot; also the blessing of a church or a chalice. An invocative blessing is rather a prayer for a person, which is capable of procuring for him spiritual and temporal favors. It may be pronounced directly over the person, like the blessing of the throat on St. Blaise's Day, or it may be pronounced over a thing with the intention of bringing down God's blessings on those who will use it. Such are the blessings of a house or of a ship, or of an automobile. The Ritual, the book used by priests in giving blessings, contains many beautiful prayers composed by the Church to call down divine benediction on her children in the various phases and activities of life. It is well to note that the Church does not hesitate to confer some of her blessings on non-Catholics as well as on Catholics.
- Since the evil spirits sometimes obsess or possess a person, the Church has formulated certain solemn exorcisms to be used on such occasions in order to drive the devils away. The law of the Church commands that no one shall perform the solemn ceremony of exorcism except a priest who has been authorized to do so by the bishop. Moreover, the priest is not allowed to use these exorcisms until he has made a diligent examination of the case to discover if the person is really being tormented by the devil. For sometimes people are afflicted with nervous troubles which bear a resemblance to diabolical possession.
- In the use of sacramentals Catholics must avoid two extremes. On the one hand, they must not regard them as intended only for children or uneducated persons. They are for all the members of the Church, and no one should consider himself so wise or so cultured as to be above the use of medals and rosaries and scapulars, and the other inspiring sacramentals of the Church. On the other hand, Catholics must not look on sacramentals as charms to bring good luck. They are intended principally for spiritual benefits, and when they do obtain material favors, it is always in conjunction with benefits of soul. There is no infallible assurance that one who wears a scapular will not be drowned, or that one who has a medal of St. Christopher in his automobile will not have an accident. Above all, it would be utterly foolish and contrary to the doctrine of the Catholic Church to imagine that one may lead a bad life, yet because of wearing a medal or a scapular, be assured of the opportunity of conversion when death strikes. Such an attitude toward the sacramentals would be a form of superstition.

#### B. PROBLEMS AND EXERCISES.

*(Answer the questions orally or write them as your teacher may direct):*

- In the earliest use of the word "sacramental," what meaning did the Church attach to the word?
- On the afternoon of her First Holy Communion, Loretta was enrolled in the five scapulars. What benefit will she derive from them?
- Edwin has his throat blessed on February 3rd, the feast of St. Blaise. A week later he is absent from school with a very sore throat. Did the blessing fail to work?
- Domitilla wants to know will it be all right to bring her cousin Prisca, a Protestant child, to the blessing of children ceremony at St. Cecilia's. Domitilla, of course, is a Catholic. St. Cecilia's is her parish church. Let her know if she may take Prisca to receive the blessing.
- Dionysia, a Catholic girl in the senior class at an exclusive secular college, goes to Communion once each season of the year. The only ornaments in her room are a dressed doll, and an autographed photograph of her favorite author. In her handbag are the usual feminine requirements, vanity case, etc., but no rosary or crucifix. She never dips her finger in the holy water font, entering or leaving the church. "That's for the common people," is her comment on the practice. Drop Dionysia a courteous note of 50 to 75 words pointing out her error, and suggesting that she make better use of religious and devotional articles.
- Anselm, a basketball player at St. Jerome's, fears he is going to be too late for the contest. He "steps on the gas," goes through a couple of red lights, passes the car ahead, as both are traveling up hill, and finally comes to grief in a serious smash-up, gravely injuring himself, and killing a man, his wife, and two children in the other car. Later, in the hospital, he remarks to his sister Eleanora. "I'm awfully sorry about what happened, but I counted on better luck because I had a swell medal of St. Christopher in the old car!" Did St. Christopher neglect Anselm? What is the reason for your answer?
- Simon, and three of his companions, go to the lake for a swim. On arriving at the lake, Simon discovers that he left his scapulars at home. The other boys have theirs, and wear them in the water. Martin, one of the boys, knows that Simon will not go into the water unless he has his scapulars with him. The distance back to Simon's house is several miles. Martin calls to Simon: "C'mon in, 'Si' and don't worry about your scapulars! The water's fine!" Should "Si" take Martin's advice? Why?
- Have scapulars, medals, badges and other articles of devotion any spiritual power in themselves? What gives them spiritual value? Spiritually, is there any difference between a bronze medal of the Immaculate Conception, a silver one, and a gold one? Explain your answer.
- On what day of the year are candles solemnly blessed? May they be blessed on other days of the year?
- Emma, the oldest lady in the parish, is about to be prepared for death by the pastor. What sacramentals will he ordinarily need in the administration of the last rites? Is it advisable to keep these articles in a box or a drawer in your home in case they are needed at any time?
- Leonie, in the seventh grade, has never missed a First Friday Communion. She is convalescing at home from a serious illness. Arrangements have been made with Father Genesius who will take Holy Communion to her. At the foot of her bed, where she can see everything easily, is a table, covered with a clean linen cloth. On it are the following articles: a crucifix, two blessed, lighted candles, a glass of fresh water, a small bottle of holy water, two small statues, one of the Sacred Heart, the other, the Immaculate Conception, two small vases of red roses, freshly cut from Leonie's garden, a spoon, rosary beads, and a clean napkin. Which of these articles are not sacramentals?
- Enumerate the fifteen mysteries of the rosary, grouping them in the order in which one follows the other. Name each group of mysteries.
- Strange incidents began to happen in the Preston home. There were unusual noises, voices were heard, and articles were thrown about the room, without any visible cause. Apparently it is a case of diabolical obsession. To whom should the family have recourse? What can the priest do about the matter?
- Denis has not been to the sacraments for many years, and when the priest urges him to receive them, he says: "I will receive the sacraments when I am in danger of death. I know I'll have the opportunity of doing so, because I wear a scapular and carry a rosary." Do you think that the attitude of Denis is praiseworthy? What would you tell him about his assurance of receiving the sacraments in the hour of death?
- The chain of Mr. Madigan's rosary frequently breaks, some of the beads are lost, and of the remaining beads some are badly cracked. Mrs. Madigan wants to buy him a new rosary but he prefers his old one for sentimental reasons. Would it be better if he got a new rosary with all the beads intact? In that event, what should he do with the old rosary?
- Mary's mother keeps two blessed candles in the house. Recently Mary had a party; she wanted to have lighted candles on the dining-room table, but her devout mother refused her the use of the blessed candles for this purpose. Mary, wondering if the blessing had made the two candles holy, talked to the pastor about her problem. He told her that the candles had received a constitutive blessing. Explain this term to Mary. Was her mother's refusal right?

## Lesson 37: Prayer `(Cầu Nguyện)`

### Q. 475. What is prayer?

**A.** Prayer is the lifting up of our minds and hearts to God.

- It is the high privilege of angels and men to speak with God in prayer, we lift up our minds to God by fixing the attention of our mind on Him; we lift up our hearts to Him by love.

> `"Let us lift up our hearts with our hands to the Lord in the heavens" (Lamentations 3:41).`

> `"Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation" (Matthew 26:41).`

> `"And he also told them a parable-that they must always pray and not lose heart" (Luke 18:1).`

> `"Jesus said to her, 'Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father also seeks such to worship him. God is spirit, and they who worship must worship in spirit and in truth' " (John 4:21-24).`

> `"Ask, and you shall receive, that your joy may be full" (John 16:24).`

> `"Be prudent therefore and watchful in prayers" (1 Peter 4:7).`

> *`See also John 17:1-26.`*

### Q. 476. Why do we pray?

**A.** We pray: first, to adore God, expressing to Him our love and loyalty; second, to thank Him for His favors; third, to obtain from Him the pardon of our sins and the remission of their punishment; fourth, to ask for graces and blessings for ourselves and others.

- Prayer is a debt we owe to God; a debt of adoration, because He is our Lord and Master; a debt of thanksgiving, because He is our first and greatest Benefactor; a debt of sorrow, because we have offended Him by our sins.

> `"Rejoice always. Pray without ceasing. In all things give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus regarding you all" (1 Thessalonians 5:16-18).`

### Q. 477. How should we pray?

**A.** We should pray: first, with attention; second, with a conviction of our own helplessness and our dependence upon God; third, with a great desire for the graces we beg of Him; fourth, with loving trust in His goodness; fifth, with perseverance.

> `"The prayer of the humble and the meek hath always pleased thee" (Judith 9:16).`

> `"Again, when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites, who love to pray standing in the synagogues and at the street corners, in order that they may be seen by men. Amen I say to you, they have received their reward. But when thou prayest, go into thy room, and closing thy door, pray to thy Father in secret; and thy Father, who sees in secret, will reward thee" (Matthew 6:5-6).`

> `"Therefore I say to you, do not be anxious for your life, what you shall eat; nor yet for your body, what you shall put on. Is not the life a greater thing than the food, and the body than the clothing? Look at the birds of the air: they do not sow, or reap, or gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are not you of much more value than they? But which of you by being anxious about it can add to his stature a single cubit? (Matthew 6:25-27).`

> `"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you. For everyone who asks, receives; and he who seeks, finds; and to him who knocks, it shall be opened. Or what man is there among you, who, if his son asks him for a loaf, will hand him a stone; or if he asks for a fish, will hand him a serpent? Therefore, if you, evil as you are, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him!" (Matthew 7:7-11).`

> `"Hypocrites, well did prophesy of you, saying, 'This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.' " (Matthew 15:7-8).`

> `"And all things whatever you ask for in prayer, believing, you shall receive" (-22).`

> `"But he spoke this parable also to some who trusted in themselves as being just and despised others. 'Two men went up to the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee and the other a publican. The Pharisee stood and began to pray thus within himself: "O God, I thank thee that I am not like the rest of men, robbers, dishonest, adulterers, or even like this publican. I fast twice a week; I pay tithes of all that I possess." But the publican, standing afar off, would not so much as lift up his eyes to heaven, but kept striking his breast, saying, "O God, be merciful to me the sinner!" I tell you, this man went back to his home justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted' " (Luke 18:9-14).`

> `"And whatever you ask in my name, that I will do" (John 14:13).`

> `"If you abide in me, and if my words abide in you, ask whatever you will and it shall be done to you" (John 15:7).`

> `"Amen, amen, I say to you, if you ask the Father anything in my name, he will give it to you. Hitherto you have not asked anything in my name. Ask, and you shall receive, that your joy may be full" (John 16:23-24).`

> `"Let us therefore draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need" (Hebrews 4:16).`

> `"For Jesus, in the days of his earthly life, with a loud cry and tears, offered up prayers and supplications to him who was able to save him from death, and was heard because of his reverent submission" (Hebrews 5:7).`

> `"But if any of you is wanting in wisdom, let him ask it of God, who gives abundantly to all men, and does not reproach; and it will be given to him. But let him ask with faith, without hesitation. For he who hesitates is like a wave of the sea, driven and carried about by the wind" (James 1:5-6).`

> `"For the unceasing prayer of a just man is of great avail" (James 5:16).`

> `"And the confidence that we have towards him is this, that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. And we know that he hears us whatever we ask; we know that the requests we make of him are granted" (1 John 5:14-15).`

### Q. 478. For whom should we pray?

**A.** We should pray especially for ourselves, for our parents, relatives, friends, and enemies, for sinners, for the souls in purgatory, for the Pope, bishops, and priests of the Church, and for the officials of our country.

> `"It is therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead, that they may be loosed from sins" (2 Machabees 12:46).`

> `"But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute and calumniate you, so that you may be children of your Father in heaven, who makes his sun to rise on the good and the evil, and sends rain on the just and the unjust" (Matthew 5:44-45).`

> `"Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak" (Matthew 26:41).`

> `"Now I exhort you, brethren, through our Lord Jesus Christ, and through the charity of the Spirit, that you help me by your prayers to God for me, that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea ..." (Romans 15:30-31).`

> `"I urge therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions and thanksgivings be made for all men; for kings, and for all in high positions, that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all piety and worthy behavior. This is good and agreeable in the sight of God our Savior, who wishes all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth" (1 Timothy 2:1-4).`

> `"Pray for one another, that you may be saved. For the unceasing prayer of a just man is of great avail" (James 5:16).`

> *`See Scripture, question 476, Matthew 6:9-13; question 477, Matthew 7:7-11; Matthew 21:22; John 16:23-24; and 1 John 5:14-15.`*

### Q. 479. How do we know that God always hears our prayers if we pray properly?

**A.** We know that God always hears our prayers if we pray properly because Our Lord has promised: "If you ask the Father anything in My name, He will give it to you."

- God is ever ready to grant our salutary petitions, but He requires us to ask Him by prayer to do so. Prayer, therefore, is the condition God has laid down for us to obtain His graces and blessings. He always answers our prayers in the way that is best for us.

> `"And whatever you ask in my name, that I will do, in order that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it" (John 14:13-14).`

> `"If you abide in me, and if my words abide in you, ask whatever you will and it shall be done to you" (John 15:7).`

> *`See Scripture, question 477, John 16:23-24.`*

### Q. 480. Why do we not always obtain what we pray for?

**A.** We do not always obtain what we pray for, either because we have not prayed properly or because God sees that what we are asking would not be for our good.

- We do not pray properly when any of the conditions mentioned in question 477 are lacking. God always knows what is best for us. We do not. He knows that often what seems good for us would harm us bodily or spiritually. No prayer is ever unanswered by God, though it is not always answered according to our petitions.

> `"Then shall they call upon me, and I will not hear: they shall rise in the morning and shall not find me. Because they have hated instruction, and received not the fear of the Lord, nor consented to my counsel, but despised all my reproof" (Proverbs 1:28-30).`

> `"He that turneth away his ears from hearing the law, his prayers shall be an abomination" (Proverbs 28:9).`

> `"You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it upon your passions" (James 4:3).`

> *`See Scripture, question 477, Matthew 6:5-6; Matthew 15:7-8; Matthew 21:22; Luke 18:9-14; James 1:5-6; James 5:16; also, question 479, John 15:7.`*

### Q. 481. Are distractions in our prayers always displeasing to God?

**A.** Distractions in our prayers are not displeasing to God, unless they are willful. Many distractions arise from natural causes, such as worry, anxiety, or bodily affliction. Other distractions are temptations of the devil. The effort made to overcome distractions makes our prayers even more pleasing to God.

> *`See Scripture, question 477, Matthew 15:7-8; Hebrews 5:7.`*

### Q. 482. How many kinds of prayer are there?

**A.** There are two kinds of prayer: mental prayer and vocal prayer.

### Q. 483. What is mental prayer?

**A.** Mental prayer is that prayer by which we unite our hearts with God while thinking of His holy truths.

> `"Let thy thoughts be upon the precepts of God, and meditate continually on his commandments: and he will give thee a heart; and the desire of wisdom shall be given to thee" (Ecclesiasticus 6:37).`

> `"For the rest, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever honorable, whatever just, whatever holy, whatever lovable, whatever of good repute, if there be any virtue, if anything worthy of praise, think upon these things" (Philippians 4:8).`

> *`See for an example of mental prayer.`*

### Q. 484. What is vocal prayer?

**A.** Vocal prayer is that prayer which comes from the mind and heart and is spoken by the lips.

- Vocal prayer can also be taken to mean all bodily prayer, such as genuflections, the bowing of the head, and the folding of hands. By vocal prayer man recognizes God's sovereignty over the whole man, body and soul.
- The use of the voice or the prayerful attitude of the body also excites greater fervor of soul. For example, those who have difficulty in merely meditating on the Passion often find it easy to make the Stations of the Cross, or to say the Sorrowful Mysteries of the Rosary. For many, a simple genuflection is the most expressive of their acts of faith in the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist.
- Vocal prayer also makes prayer in common possible. Prayer in common is that of many praying as one, such as the prayer of a family or of a congregation saying the Rosary together.

> `"With my voice I called upon the Lord, and he hearkened to me from his holy mountain" (Psalm 3:5).`

> `"O Lord, thou wilt open my lips, and my mouth shall declare thy praise" (Psalms 50:17).`

> `"For where two or three are gathered together for my sake, there am I in the midst of them" (Matthew 18:20).`

> `"At the name of Jesus every knee should bend of those in heaven, on earth and under the earth, and every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father" (Philippians 2:10-11).`

### Q. 485. May we use our own words in praying to God?

**A.** We may use our own words in praying to God, and it is well to do so often.

### Q. 486. What are the prayers that every Catholic should know by heart?

**A.** The prayers that every Catholic should know by heart are: the Our Father, the Hail Mary, the Apostles' Creed, the Confiteor, the Glory be to the Father, and the acts of faith, hope, charity, and contrition.

> `"Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, of the house of David, and the virgin's name was Mary. And when the angel had come to her, he said, 'Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women.' When she had heard him she was troubled at his word, and kept pondering what manner of greeting this might be" (Luke 1:26-29).`

> `"Now in those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a town of Juda. And she entered the house of Zachary and saluted Elizabeth. And it came to pass, when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary that the babe in her womb leapt. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, and cried out with a loud voice, saying, 'Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb! And how have I deserved that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold, the moment that the sound of thy greeting came to my ears, the babe in my womb leapt for joy. And blessed is she who has believed, because the things promised her by the Lord shall be accomplished' " (Luke 1:39-45).`

> *`See Scripture, question 476, Matthew 6:9-13.`*

### Q. 487. How do we usually begin and end our prayers?

**A.** We usually begin and end our prayers with the sign of the cross.

> `"And Jesus drew near and spoke to them saying, 'All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit' " (Matthew 28:18-19).`

### Q. 488. Why do we make the sign of the cross?

**A.** We make the sign of the cross to express two important mysteries of the Christian religion, the Blessed Trinity and the Redemption.

> `"And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us" (John 1:14).`

> `"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that those who believe in him may not perish, but may have life everlasting. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that those who believe in him may not perish, but may have life everlasting" (John 3:14-16).`

> `"And bearing the cross for himself, he went forth to the place called the Skull, in Hebrew, Golgotha, where they crucified him" (John 19:17-18).`

> `"Who himself bore our sins in his body upon the tree, that we, having died to sin, might live to justice; and by his stripes you were healed" (1 Peter 2:24).`

> *`See Scripture, Lesson 3; also question 487, Matthew 28:18-19).`*

### Q. 489. How are these mysteries expressed by the sign of the cross?

**A.** When we say "In the name," we express the truth that there is only one God; when we say "of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost," we express the truth that there are three distinct Persons in God; and when we make the form of the cross on ourselves, we express the truth that the Son of God, made man, redeemed us by His death on the cross.

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT PRAYER

- Our reason tells us that, as creatures, we are obliged to pray to God, in order to adore Him, to thank Him, to ask Him for what we need, and to seek His pardon for our sins. Faith teaches us the same truth. The Bible abounds with references to man's obligation to pray. And in order to give us an example, Our Divine Redeemer prayed while He was on earth. Sometimes He spent even entire nights in prayer. Two of the most striking incidents of His passion were acts of prayer-His prayer in the Garden asking that, if possible, the cup of suffering might pass away, followed immediately by His sublime act of resignation to His Father's will, and His prayer on the cross, asking pardon for those who were putting Him to death.
- Although prayer is intended not only to ask God for favors but also to praise and to thank Him and to make reparation for sin, we often use the word in the restricted sense of asking benefits, whether spiritual or temporal. This is the prayer of petition. To this prayer Christ has attached unfailing efficacy, provided it is offered with the necessary qualities, for He said: "Amen, amen, I say to you if you ask the Father anything in my name, He will give it to you" (John, 16:23). Of course, for the fulfillment of this promise we must pray humbly and perseveringly, and confidingly. Sometimes God does not grant us a favor the first time we ask; He wishes us to continue to implore His mercy. Moreover, we cannot expect Him to grant us a temporal favor, such as health and riches, if he foresees that it would be harmful to our soul, any more than we could expect a mother to give her child a knife, for which he is crying, since she knows he would injure himself. Finally, we must remember that Our Lord spoke of prayer offered for ourselves. We can and should pray for others, and we can often obtain for them precious favors; but infallible efficacy is attached to prayer only when a person prays for himself.
- Through prayer we can procure for ourselves immeasurable spiritual blessings-the power to overcome temptations, no matter how violent, the grace to increase in love for God, and above all, perseverance in the state of grace and eternal salvation. St. Alphonsus Liguori, who is called the Doctor of Prayer because he wrote so much about it and practiced it so ardently, did not hesitate to say: "He who prays will be saved, he who does not pray will be lost."
- Naturally we pray when we go to Mass or receive the sacraments or perform some other religious duty. But we should not limit our prayers to these occasions. In the morning we should pray for God's guidance during the day; at night we should pray for forgiveness of any faults or sins we may have committed in the course of the day and for protection of soul and body during the night. Strictly speaking, it is not a sin to omit morning and night prayers, provided a person prays at some other time; but it is a sin to neglect prayer entirely. The most appropriate place for prayer is the church, where Our Lord is present in the Blessed Sacrament, but we can pray in any place. In time of temptation our first thought should be to pray for divine assistance; above all, frequently in the course of the day we should raise our mind and heart to God in brief but fervent aspirations. Any Catholic who fills his life with prayer in this manner will be living up to the injunction of Our Lord, who said that we must always pray and not lose heart (Luke, 18:1).
- Mental prayer, which is also called meditation, constitutes one of the most effective means toward sanctification. Hence, the rules of all religious orders call for frequent periods of meditation-sometimes as much as two hours every day. It can be practiced by the members of the laity also, and from it they can derive great spiritual profit. Many good Catholic lay-persons devote fifteen minutes or a half-hour to meditation daily, choosing particularly as the subject of their contemplation and prayer the life and the teachings of Our Blessed Lord. Meditation is especially beneficial in the morning, when we can look forward to the difficulties of the day in a spirit of faith and humbly ask God for light and grace to do His will in all things.
- Vocal prayers are also recommended by the Church, and many of them, such as the rosary and the litanies, are richly indulgenced. However, it would be a mistake to imagine that the more vocal prayers a person recites, the holier he is. It is better to say a few vocal prayers slowly and attentively than to recite a large number hurriedly and with little attention.
- Spiritual reading is one of the most practical helps toward praying as we should. By this we mean the reading of books about Our Lord, the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Saints, the practice of virtue, etc. In every Catholic home there should be devotional books on hand for the members of the family; above all, there should be a Bible, and the members of the family, old and young, should be accustomed to read it regularly. It is a beautiful custom when all the members of a family assemble at a set time daily-for example, after the evening meal-to hear a portion of the Bible read by the father or the mother or one of the children. Pope Leo XIII granted an indulgence of 300 days to all Catholics who spend at least fifteen minutes in reading Holy Scripture with the reverence due to the word of God and after the manner of spiritual reading.
- The sign of the cross, with which we Catholics begin and end our prayers, is not merely our profession of faith in the Holy Trinity and the Redemption, but is also our petition for the blessing of the three divine Persons on our lives and actions. Hence, we should always make the sign of the cross reverently. It is disedifying to see this holy sign made so carelessly and so rapidly that one can hardly recognize what it is intended to be. The Church grants an indulgence of 100 days to the faithful as often as they make the sign of the cross with the prescribed words, and 300 days whenever they make it with holy water.
- There is a special value attached to prayer recited in common by several persons - for example, a family, a sodality, a congregation - because Our Lord promised His special blessing on prayer of this kind when He said: "Where two or three are gathered together for my sake, there am I in the midst of them" (Matthew, 18:20).

## Lesson 38: The Our Father `(Kinh Lạy Cha)`

### Q. 490. Why is the Our Father the best of all prayers?

**A.** The Our Father is the best of all prayers because it is the Lord's Prayer, taught us by Jesus Christ Himself, and because it is a prayer of perfect and unselfish love.

### Q. 492. For what do we pray when we say "Our Father who art in heaven?"

**A.** We address God as "Our Father who art in heaven," because we belong to Him, our loving Father, who created us and watches over us, who adopts us through sanctifying grace as His children, and who destines us to live forever with Him in heaven, our true home.

> `"In that day you shall ask in my name; and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father for you, for the Father himself loves you because you have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from God" (John 16:26-27).`

> `"For whoever are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. Now you have not received a spirit of bondage so as to be again in fear, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons, by virtue of which we cry, 'Abba! Father!' The Spirit himself gives testimony to our spirit that we are sons of God. But if we are sons, we are heirs also: heirs indeed of God and joint heirs with Christ, provided, however, we suffer with him that we may also be glorified with him" (Romans 8:14-17).`

> `"Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God; and such we are. This is why the world does not know us, because it did not know him. Beloved, now we are the children of God, and it has not yet appeared what we shall be. We know that, when he appears, we shall be like to him, for we shall see him just as he is. And everyone who has this hope in him makes himself holy, just as he also is holy" (1 John 3:1-3).`

> `"Therefore I say to you, do not be anxious for your life, what you shall eat; nor yet for your body, what you shall put on. Is not the life a greater thing than the food, and the body than the clothing? Look at the birds of the air: they do not sow, or reap, or gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are not you of much more value than they? But which of you by being anxious about it can add to his stature a single cubit? "`

> `"And as for clothing, why are you anxious? Consider how the lilies of the field grow; they neither toil nor spin, yet I say to you that not even in all his glory was arrayed like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which flourishes today but tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more you, O you of little faith!' Therefore do not be anxious, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or, 'What shall we drink?' or, 'What are we to put on?' (For after all these things the Gentiles seek); for your Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first the kingdom of God and his justice, and all these things shall be given you besides" (Matthew 6:25-33).`

> `"Then his master called him, and said to him, 'Wicked servant! I forgave thee all the debt, because thou didst entreat me. Shouldst not thou also have had pity on thy fellow-servant, even as I had pity on thee?' And his master, being angry, handed him over to the torturers until he should pay all that was due to him. So also my heavenly Father will do to you, if you do not each forgive your brothers from your hearts" (Matthew 18:32-35).`

> `"And when you stand up to pray, forgive whatever you have against anyone, that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your offenses. But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive you your offenses" (Mark 11:25-26).`

> `"The imagination and thought of man's heart are prone to evil from his youth" (Genesis 8:21).`

> `"Because thou wast acceptable to God, it was necessary that temptation should prove thee" (Tobias 12:13).`

> `"Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall. May no temptation take hold of you but such as man is equal to. God is faithful and will not permit you to be tempted beyond your strength, but with the temptation will also give you a way out that you may be able to bear it" (1 Corinthians 10:12-13).`

> `"Let no man say when he is tempted, that he is tempted by God; for God is no tempter to evil, and he himself tempts no one. But everyone is tempted by being drawn away and enticed by his own passion. Then when passion has conceived, it brings forth sin" (James 1:13-15).`

> `"Be sober, be watchful! For your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goes about seeking someone to devour. Resist him, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same suffering befalls your brethren all over the world.

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT THE OUR FATHER

- We could not say a better prayer than that which Jesus Christ Himself taught us. Hence, the "Lord's Prayer," or "Our Father," has always been the form of prayer most frequently employed in the Catholic Church. It is the prayer which Our Lord taught us in His Sermon on the Mount (Matthew, 6:9-13), and was repeated by Him in substantially the same form on another occasion when the disciples asked Him: "Lord, teach us to pray" (Luke, 11:1-4). All the elements of prayer-adoration, thanksgiving, petition, atonement-are found in this brief formula; and because of its perfection, as well as its divine origin, the Catholic Church has always used this prayer in its public worship, and urges its members to recite it often in their private devotions. It is sung or recited in the Canon of the Mass, between the Consecration and the Communion; it is said frequently in the course of the Divine Office which priests and religious recite every day; it is one of the prayers that must be learned as a matter of obligation by all Catholics.
- In the opening words of the Lord's Prayer we address as "Father" the three Persons of the Blessed Trinity. We say "Our" and not "My" Father to indicate that all human beings are members of one great family of which God is the Father, and that we should pray for one another, not merely for ourselves.
- Most Protestants, in reciting the "Our Father" add the words: "For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory." This phrase is found in some of the texts of the Scripture dating from early days, and in itself this expression is an excellent prayer praising God. Indeed, it is added to the "Our Father" by many Catholics of the Oriental rites. However, Latin Catholics do not say it because the more ancient and more reliable manuscripts of Scripture do not contain it, and the Church in the Latin rite has never adopted it.
- In connection with the Our Father, it is appropriate to speak of the next best known prayer in the Catholic Church, the Hail Mary, and the favorite prayer of Catholics to the Mother of God. This prayer is divided into three parts: (1) "Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee" is the salutation given to Mary by the Archangel at the time of the Annunciation. For this reason the Hail Mary is sometimes called the angelic salutation. (2) "Blessed is the fruit of thy womb" is the phrase spoken by St. Elizabeth to Our Lady at the Visitation. (3) "Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen," is the part added by the Church.
- The Catholic Church has always honored the Blessed Virgin Mary. However, the use of the "Hail Mary" developed only gradually in the course of the centuries. At first this prayer contained only the portions given in the New Testament in the words of the Archangel Gabriel and St. Elizabeth. Later, around the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the custom arose of adding the words: "Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us." The form of this prayer as we have it today was officially approved by the Church in the year 1570.
- There are many other vocal prayers to Our Lord, Our Lady and the Saints approved by the Church. These can be found in authorized prayer-books. Among the best known of these prayers to the Blessed Virgin are the "Hail, Holy Queen," the "Angelus," and the Litany of the Blessed Virgin. There are also other Litanies in use in the Church, especially the Litany of the Holy Name of Jesus, the Litany of the Sacred Heart, the Litany of St. Joseph, the Litany of the Saints, and the Litany of the Dying. Every Catholic should have a prayer-book and use the prayers according to his particular needs and devotion. Catholics should be on their guard against unauthorized prayers, especially those known as "chain-prayers," which people pass from one to another, and which are supposed to confer wonderful favors if recited a certain number of times. Such prayers are superstitious, and often even opposed to the Church's doctrines. A Catholic should destroy any copy of such a prayer that is given to him, and should refuse to pass copies to others.
- In regard to the use of vocal prayers, two points are to be noted. First, we should recite these prayers carefully, and without too great haste. Some Catholics are very diligent in reciting many vocal prayers, but they mumble them hastily, mispronouncing and cutting off syllables. It would be better if they said fewer prayers, but said them reverently. Second, we must remember that prayers said with the lips are of no value unless they come from the heart. Hence, while reciting our vocal prayers we should try to avoid distractions and to be attentive to the great act we are performing.

### RESOLUTION

- Resolve that whenever you recite your prayers, especially the "Our Father" and the "Hail Mary," you will try to pronounce the words properly and realize that you are speaking to God or to the Mother of God.

#### B. PROBLEMS AND EXERCISES.

*(Answer the questions orally or write them as your teacher may direct):*

- Every now and then after Holy Communion, Willibrord, instead of reading the of Thanksgiving from his prayer book, recites slowly and thoughtfully the Our Father from five to ten times. Do you think that he is making a good thanksgiving on such occasions? Why?
- Earl, Columba, Rene, and Isaac are having a discussion. Earl claims that the Lord's Prayer is addressed to God the Father; Columba says it is to God the Son; Rene holds that it is directed to God the Holy Ghost, while Isaac maintains that the Our Father is said to the Most Blessed Trinity. Who is right?
- Is the United States of America our true home, or is it elsewhere?
- Olaf is making a campaign speech in behalf of religious and racial tolerance. Several times during his speech he uses the expression "the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of man." Is there anything in the Lord's Prayer that indicates the truth of that expression?
- How many kingdoms of God are discussed in this lesson? Where are they?
- Elgius would like to know if the Hail Mary is a prayer of praise. If so, tell him who are praised in the Hail Mary.
- Who were the first creatures to utter the terms of praise now enshrined in the Hail Mary?
- Daphne, a Catholic teacher in a public school, once asked in a test "Who is the most truly privileged woman of history?" Some of the pupils in her grade answered "Florence Nightingale," others, "Martha Washington," "Mary, Queen of Scots," "Queen Isabella of Spain," and so on. Some of the children wrote the names of famous women living at the present time. Daphne was delighted to note that the five Catholics in her class, without exception, wrote "The Blessed Virgin Mary." Do you agree with them? Why?
- When is it most important that we be in the state of grace? Why? Is there any prayer that you can say repeatedly between now and then that will help you at that moment? What prayer is it?
- Jack and Tom get into a discussion about the meaning of the word "hallowed" in the Our Father. Jack contends that it means "shouted" while Tom says that it means "repeated." Can you settle the argument by telling in your own words the true meaning of "hallowed?"
- Erasmus, Claud, and Crispin know the Litany of the Blessed Virgin by heart. Can you name four other litanies in general use-litanies approved by the church? Which are they?
- Stephen, a Latin Catholic, Calvin, a Protestant, and Athanasius, a Greek boy all belong to the same football team. Once before an important game, they recited together the Our Father for the team's success. Stephen finished his first; Calvin and Athanasius both added an extra phrase at the end of theirs. What is that phrase? Why don't Latin Catholics use it?
- Walter finds a chain prayer in the back of the church. He reads it, and becomes frightened because it threatens that bad luck will fall on the one who refuses to write the prayer out nine times and distribute it to nine others. Advise him what to do.
- Eligius asked Fr. Honorius why it is that in the Our Father we ask God not to lead us into temptation. Since God is all-good and wishes us to avoid sin, it seems strange that He should ever lead us into temptation. What answer do you think Fr. Honorius gave to Eligius?
- Marvin became angry at Juniper one day, because in a game of basketball Juniper was unnecessarily rough and kicked Marvin several times in the shins. When Marvin came home that afternoon he told his mother about the incident, and exclaimed angrily: "Juniper played a mean trick on me, and I won't forgive him until I have a chance to get even with him." His mother made no answer to this remark, but that night, as Marvin was about to go to bed, she remarked gently: "When you say your night prayers, I don't see how you can honestly say all that is contained in the Our Father." To what words of the Our Father do you think Marvin's mother was referring? How could he have disposed his soul so that he could have said those words honestly and sincerely?

**A.** We can prove that all men are obliged to practice religion because all men are entirely dependent on God and must recognize that dependence by honoring Him and praying to Him.

### Q. 504. How can we prove that the religion God has revealed through Christ is worthy of belief?

**A.** We can prove that the religion God has revealed through Christ is worthy of belief, because: first, Jesus Christ, announcing Himself as the ambassador and the true Son of God, Whose coming was foretold by the prophets, preached doctrines which He said all must believe; second, Christ worked wonderful miracles, which show that the God of truth approved His teachings.

### Q. 505. How can we prove that Christ established a Church which all are obliged to join?

### Q. 515. How can we help the missions?

**A.** We can help the missions: first, by praying for the missions, home and foreign, and for missionaries that they may fulfill the command of Christ: "Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations"; second, by knowing the missions and making them known to others; third, by making sacrifices for the missions, that is, by helping to support them and by personal service; fourth, by fostering vocations of self-sacrificing young men and women for every need of the missions.

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT THE REASONS FOR OUR FAITH

- Many non-Catholics believe that Catholic faith is a blind acceptance of the Church's teachings without any attempt to use the powers of reason and logic. On the contrary, unless a person uses his own intelligence to come to the conviction that the truths of the Catholic religion have been revealed by God, he can never make a true act of faith. Even a child, before he can make an act of faith, must have some realization that it is reasonable to do so, at least from the testimony of his parents. And if an intelligent person examines the claims of the Church honestly and thoroughly, he will eventually conclude that the Catholic religion is the one true religion of God, and that all are obliged to believe it. Then, if he sincerely prays to God for light and strength to do what is right, he will surely be led to make a firm act of faith in the truths taught by the Catholic Church.
- Bearing this in mind, the question naturally arises: Why are there so many persons outside the Catholic Church? There are many reasons for this. Many of those persons have never had the opportunity of studying the Catholic religion; many are so absorbed in the interests of the present life that they have no care for the welfare of their immortal soul; many have prejudices and false ideas concerning the Catholic Church. It must be admitted that sometimes Catholics themselves are to blame, by their wicked lives, which lead people to the erroneous conclusion that the Catholic religion cannot be true. For it is quite usual to judge the merits of a religion by the conduct of some of those who profess it.
- Often the statement is made that Catholics are intolerant. This is partially true and partially false. Catholics are not intolerant toward persons belonging to other religions; for the Catholic religion commands that we be charitable toward all men and regard those who differ from us in religious matters as being sincere in their belief. But Catholics are intolerant toward doctrines opposed to the teachings of the Catholic Church in the sense that they logically regard such doctrines as false since they are contrary to the teachings of the true Church which is protected from error by the Holy Ghost.
- The Catholic Church has been authorized by Christ to teach the truths of divine revelation, found in the Bible and in divine Tradition. The Bible contains 72 books-45 in the Old Testament and 27 in the New Testament. Most of the books of the Old Testament were originally written in Hebrew and most of the books of the New Testament in Greek. The Church can teach and explain authoritatively and infallibly not only the doctrines that are contained in the Bible and in divine Tradition, but also doctrines which have not been revealed but are connected with divine revelation; and Catholics are bound in conscience to accept these teachings of the Church.
- There is need of Catholics who understand their religion and perceive how reasonable it is to accept its teachings, and who will bring to their non-Catholic friends, when the opportunity is offered, the arguments for their faith. Often a Catholic lay person can be the means of leading a soul to the knowledge of the truth. But only Catholics who know their religion thoroughly can hope to perform such a deed of charity, for objections and difficulties in great numbers are brought up, and if a non-Catholic sees that the Catholic cannot give a satisfactory answer, he will wrongly conclude that the Catholic religion offers a very unsatisfactory solution of the problems of the modern world. Of course, the Catholic himself must lead a good, honest life, if he wishes to persuade his non-Catholic acquaintances that his religion is the only true one.
- Catholics themselves should show their appreciation of the great gift of the one true faith by studying it constantly and by daily endeavoring to put it more perfectly into practice in their lives. It is indeed a great privilege to be a Catholic. That privilege is possessed by only one out of every six persons in this world. Truly, a sense of gratitude should impel us all to live up to the duties of our Catholic faith so exactly that each day we shall draw nearer to God and increase our merit in the glorious kingdom of Christ, when we shall pass from the Church militant to the Church triumphant.

#### B. PROBLEMS AND EXERCISES.

*(Answer the questions orally or write them as your teacher may direct):*

- Conon, a devout Catholic young man, is accustomed after meals to say this short prayer: "We return Thee thanks, 0 Almighty God, for Thy benefits, who livest and reignest, world without end. Amen." Is thankfulness for the gift of faith included in this prayer? Why?
- Emiliana, a child in the third grade, has been taught by her pious mother to share her pennies with the Child Jesus. She does this by putting five of them in her penny back each week during the school year. During the Ember seasons, Emiliana, and her classmates, give the pennies to Sister Rosalia, in charge of the Holy Childhood Association. Is little Emiliana helping the Missions? How?
- From early youth, Macarius, a non-Catholic, was taught to look down upon Catholics in general, and to despise priests and religious, in particular. If he sees a priest, or a brother, or a sister, approaching him on the same side of the street, he will cross over to the other side to avoid them. Is Macarius tolerant of Catholics? Comment charitably on the case in from 30 to 50 words. Presume that God is going to use you as the instrument of Macarius' conversion.
- A Jewish widow, Basilissa, owns a delicatessen store. Every now and then, Christian boys and girls of the neighborhood, torment her, ridiculing her Jewish religious practices, and committing petty thefts of her wares. Can these children be called intolerant? Within 75 words, what would you say to them, if they would listen to you?
- In a rain shelter on the golf course, three golfers while away the time discussing the doctrinal intolerance of the Catholic Church. Gerson, a Protestant, is a professor of mathematics in a Baptist College. Laban, a Jew, teaches chemistry in the local high school. Mel, a Catholic, is a structural engineer. Claver, Mel's colored caddy, is an honor pupil in the High School of St. Protus. He is shocked to hear Mel agree with his golfing companions that it doesn't make much difference what a person believes so long as he lives rightly. About to resume the game, Mel asks Claver for his point of view. He is humbly edified and corrected by Claver's answer, which is aptly illustrated by examples from mathematics, chemistry, and engineering. What is doctrinal intolerance? Try to duplicate Claver's achievement in three short letters to Gerson, Laban, and Mel. Confine your letters to about 250 words each.
- Lambert, a friend of yours, has no formal religion; but he holds fast to two reasonable principles, namely, that there is a God, and that his own soul will live on forever. Drop him a short note, adding four more principles that will indicate to him as a reasonable friend, the truth of your own Catholic religion.
- In the Islands, Sister Seraphia is teaching the little natives the truth that there is a God. These youngsters are not as familiar as you are with modern inventions; but they are perhaps more familiar with the powers and the grandeur of nature. Write a brief letter to the missionary nun, telling her how you would go about proving God's existence to these simple native children. Confine your letter to 200 words.
- Alicia asked the religion teacher whether human beings would be bound to practice religion if God had not made any revelation. What answer do you think should be given? In that supposition, would men be bound to believe in God's existence, the immortality of the human soul, the Holy Trinity, the eternal happiness of heaven?
- Days of Fast and Abstinence
- Beginning with Lent, 1952 many of the bishops of the United States, using the provisions of Canon Law as modified through the special faculties granted by the Holy See, published the following regulations on fast and abstinence:
- ABSTINENCE: All persons over seven years of age must abstain. This means that they may not take meat or meat gravy or meat soup at all on days of complete abstinence, which are all Fridays, Ash Wednesday, and the vigils of the Assumption and of Christmas. They may take meat, but only at the principal meal, on days of partial abstinence, which are Ember Wednesdays and Saturdays, and the vigils of Pentecost and of All Saints' Day. On Holy Saturday meat may not be taken until noon, when both abstinence and fast cease.
- FASTS: All persons over twenty-one and under fifty-nine years of age must fast. This means that on a fast day they may have only one principal, or full, meal and two smaller meals. They may eat meat at this principal meal, except on days of complete abstinence. At the two smaller meals they may not have meat, but they may take sufficient food to maintain their strength. However, these two smaller meals together should be less than a full meal. Eating between meals is not permitted, but liquids, including milk and fruit juices, may be taken at any time on a fast day. The days of fast are the weekdays of Lent up to Holy Saturday noon, the Ember Days, and the vigils of Pentecost, the Assumption, All Saints and Christmas.
- Those not bound to fast may eat meat as often as they wish, except on days of complete abstinence (when it may not be eaten at all), and on days of partial abstinence (when it may be eaten only at the principal meal). When a person's health or ability to work would be seriously affected by fasting or abstaining, the law does not oblige. Where doubt arises concerning fast or abstinence, a parish priest or confessor should be consulted.
- In granting these concessions the bishops urged the faithful: to attend daily Mass during the period of fast and abstinence; to receive Holy Communion often; to take part more frequently in exercises of piety; to give generously to works of religion and charity; to perform acts of kindness toward the sick, the aged and the poor; to practice voluntary self-denial; to pray more fervently, particularly for the intentions of the Holy Father.
- 1 (Since these regulations were issued, Holy Saturday has been made a day of fast and complete abstinence up to midnight by the general law of the Church. However, some Bishops dispense from the abstinence, either wholly or partially, or from the fast, or from both. The fast and abstinence for the vigil of the Assumption (August 14) have been transferred to the vigil of the Immaculate Conception (December 7). In regard to the observation of fast and abstinence on the day before All Saints, Catholics should follow the instructions of their respective Bishops.)
