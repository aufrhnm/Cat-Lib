## Lesson 23: The Sacraments `(Các Bí tích)`

### Q. 304. What is a sacrament?

**A.** A sacrament is an outward sign instituted by Christ to give grace.

- Man, composed of body and soul, lives in the midst of visible things, deals with them constantly, and gains his knowledge from them. His knowledge of spiritual things depends on the use of his senses. It was fitting, therefore, that the sacraments, which were to bring man the supernatural, spiritual gifts of grace, be instituted by Christ as **visible signs** which could be perceived by man.
- In each of the sacraments there is an **outward sign**, that is, some external thing or action called the **matter**, and a set formula of words known as the **form**. The matter and the form together make up the sign of each sacrament. In the sacrament of Baptism, for example, the matter consists in the water; and in its application to the person being baptized; the form is the sentence: "I baptize thee in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost," which is said while the water is being poured.
- When the sign is applied to the one who receives the sacrament, it signifies inward grace and has the power of producing it in the soul. The external action performed by the minister of the sacrament is called a sign of the inward grace because it signifies and represents outwardly what is produced inwardly and invisibly in the soul. The sacramental signs actually effect what they represent. In Baptism, for example, the application of the water and the pronouncing of the words are a sign which both represents the **cleansing of the soul from sin** and actually effects that cleansing.
- The sacramental signs were **instituted by Christ**. Our Lord is the Author of all the sacraments. Only God can give to material things or to outward signs the power of producing grace in the soul.
- Although Christ instituted all seven sacraments before ascending into heaven, He did not completely specify the matter and form of all the sacraments as clearly and definitely as He did for Baptism and the Eucharist. Christ gave His Church the power to make certain determinations in the matter and form of some of the sacraments.

### Q. 305. How many sacraments are there?

**A.** There are seven sacraments: Baptism, Confirmation, Holy Eucharist, Penance, Extreme Unction, Holy Orders, and Matrimony.

- Christ instituted seven sacraments to supply the various needs of the spiritual life of man. Baptism is the sacrament of spiritual rebirth; Confirmation is the sacrament of spiritual strength and maturity; the Holy Eucharist gives us food for spiritual nourishment; Penance is the cure for the spiritual sickness of sin committed after Baptism; Extreme Unction strengthens us when dying; Holy Orders provides for the work of the Church; and Matrimony provides for the social needs of the Church. Christ instituted the seven sacraments during His public ministry and after His Resurrection before ascending into heaven.

### Q. 306. From whom do the sacraments receive their power to give grace?

**A.** The sacraments receive their power to give grace from God, through the merits of Jesus Christ.

- All grace, including the grace of the sacraments, comes from God through Jesus Christ, who merited it for all men by His life, His passion, and His death.
- God uses the seven sacraments as instruments to produce grace in our souls. Christ willed that the sacraments be administered by men who act in His name. Although faith and sanctity of life should characterize the minister, they are not required for the valid administration of the sacraments. That the minister validly confer the sacraments it is necessary: first, that he have the power of administering them; second, that he have jurisdiction for those sacraments which require it; third, that he perform all the essential ceremonies; fourth, that he have the intention of at least "doing what the Church does," that is, of performing the sacred ceremony that is usual among Catholics.

> `"They are justified freely by his grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus, whom God has set forth as a propitiation by his blood through faith" (Romans 3:24-25).`

> `"Let a man so account us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God" (1 Corinthians 4:1).`

### Q. 307. Do the sacraments give sanctifying grace?

**A.** The sacraments do give sanctifying grace.

> `"Amen, amen, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, you shall not have life in you. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has life everlasting and I will raise him up on the last day" (John 6:54-55).`

> `"Receive the Holy Spirit; whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained" (John 20:22-23).`

> `"Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter" (Acts 8:14).`

> `"For all you who have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ" (Galatians 3:27).`

> `"For this reason I admonish thee to stir up the grace of God which is in thee by the laying of hands" (2 Timothy 1:6).`

> `"He saved us through the bath of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit" (Titus 3:5).`

### Q. 308. Does each of the sacraments also give a special grace?

**A.** Each of the sacraments also gives a special grace, called **sacramental grace**, which helps one to carry out the particular purpose of that sacrament.

- The sacramental grace of Baptism is a regenerative grace that helps us to live well the new supernatural life we have begun; the sacramental grace of Confirmation is a strengthening grace which helps us to profess our faith openly; the sacramental grace of Holy Eucharist is a nourishing and unitive grace that helps us to be united more closely to God and to one another by supernatural charity; the sacramental grace of Penance is a curative grace that helps us to detest sin effectively, to satisfy for sin committed, and to avoid future sin; the sacramental grace of Extreme Unction is an alleviating grace that comforts us in our last agony, and helps us to overcome final temptations; the sacramental grace of Holy Orders is a consecrating grace that helps bishops and priests to discharge the duties of the sacred ministry faithfully; and the sacramental grace of Matrimony is a grace that helps the married couple to live chastely and to fulfill their duties to each other and to their children.

### Q. 309. Do the sacraments always give grace?

**A.** The sacraments always give grace if we receive them with the right dispositions.

- The sacraments, validly administered, always give grace to those who receive them with the right dispositions, because the power of the sacraments does not depend on anything human but solely on the will of God as expressed by Christ when He instituted them. The right dispositions do not produce the grace; they merely remove the obstacles that would prevent the reception of grace. The right dispositions, or the acts and habits required as conditions in order that the sacraments have their effect, vary with the different sacraments.
- It is important to prepare fervently for the reception of the sacraments, because ordinarily they confer grace in proportion to our dispositions.

> `"Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily, will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord" (1 Corinthians 11:27).`

> `"Is anyone among you sick? Let him bring in the presbyters of the Church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the sick man, and the Lord will raise him up, and if he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him" (James 5:14-15).`

### Q. 310. Why are Baptism and Penance called sacraments of the dead?

**A.** Baptism and Penance are called sacraments of the dead because their chief purpose is to give the supernatural life of sanctifying grace to souls spiritually dead through sin.

- The sacraments of the dead increase sanctifying grace when they are received by one who is already in the state of grace. Thus when a person who has only venial sins to confess receives absolution in the sacrament of Penance, he receives an increase of sanctifying grace.

> `"Amen, amen, I say to thee, unless a man be born again of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" (John 3:5).`

> *`See also Scripture, question 307, John 20:22-23.`*

### Q. 311. Why are Confirmation, Holy Eucharist, Extreme Unction, Holy Orders, and Matrimony called sacraments of the living?

**A.** Confirmation, Holy Eucharist, Extreme Unction, Holy Orders, and Matrimony are called **sacraments of the living** because their chief purpose is to give more grace to souls already spiritually alive through sanctifying grace.

### Q. 312. What sin does one commit who knowingly receives a sacrament of the living in mortal sin?

**A.** He who knowingly receives a sacrament of the living in **mortal sin** commits a mortal sin of **sacrilege**, because he treats a sacred thing with grave irreverence.

> *`See Scripture, question 309, 1 Corinthians 11:27.`*

### Q. 313. Which are the sacraments that can be received only once?

**A.** The sacraments that can be received only once are **Baptism, Confirmation, and Holy Orders**.

### Q. 314. Why can Baptism, Confirmation, and Holy Orders be received only once?

**A.** Baptism, Confirmation, and Holy Orders can be received only once because they imprint on the soul a **spiritual mark**, called a **character**, which lasts forever.

- A **character** is a spiritual quality enabling a person to discharge the duty of worshiping God according to the laws of Christ and His Church. The character places on the soul the sign of Christ, the Eternal Priest, and gives the one who receives it a special position in the service of Christ. The indelible character received in Baptism enables one to receive the other sacraments; in Confirmation, the character enables one to profess the Christian faith before its enemies; in Holy Orders, the character enables one to consecrate oneself to the work of administering the sacraments to other persons.
- The character imprinted on the soul by Baptism and Confirmation imposes the obligation of being a **lay apostle**, that is, of bringing the faith and the grace of Christ to others under the leadership and the guidance of the Pope and bishops.
- Persons who have received a sacramental character are forever distinguished from those who have not received it. Thus it will forever be a mark of glory for those who are saved, but a mark of shame for those who are lost.

> `"Now it is God who is warrant for us and for you in Christ, who has anointed us, who has also stamped us with his seal and has given us the Spirit as a pledge in our hearts" (2 Corinthians 1:21-22).`

> `"And in him you too, when you had heard the word of truth, the good news of your salvation, and believed in it, were sealed with the Holy Spirit ... for a redemption of possession, for the praise of His Glory" (Ephesians 1:13-14).`

> `"And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption" (Ephesians 4:30).`

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT THE SACRAMENTS

- Before He ascended into heaven, Our Blessed Lord decided to establish means of communicating to the souls of men the graces He had merited by His life and death. For this purpose, Our Saviour willed to use **external ceremonies**, signs that could be perceived by men through their bodily senses. Human beings derive their knowledge by the use of their senses, and what appeals to their senses makes a greater impression than something that is perceived by the intellect alone; hence, Our Lord decided to suit His means of grace to man's nature. Accordingly, He instituted **seven signs**, or external ceremonies, capable of giving grace. He chose the particular signs to satisfy the most urgent spiritual needs of men. And, as will become more apparent in the lessons to follow, He adapted the sacraments to a plan of the spiritual life very similar to the course of man's natural life from the cradle to the grave.
- A sacrament is an instrument of God's power and goodness. Just as an artist, using his brush as an instrument, paints a beautiful picture, so God through the sacraments draws His own image on the soul of man.
- However, the sacraments give grace dependently on man's **cooperation**. It is true, when a child who has not reached the age of reason receives a sacrament, God gives him the graces of the sacrament without demanding any dispositions. But when a person has once reached the use of reason, he must do his part in order to be sanctified. Such a person cannot receive a sacrament **validly**—that is, really—unless he has at least a general intention of receiving it. The external rite could indeed be forced on him, but it would not be a real sacrament unless he consented to receive it. Moreover, one who has attained the age of reason cannot receive a sacrament **fruitfully**—that is, with its graces—unless he has in his soul suitable dispositions as a becoming preparation. Generally speaking, the disposition required of an adult for the reception of a **sacrament of the dead**—that is Baptism or Penance—is sorrow for sin based on faith; and the essential disposition for a worthy reception of one of the **sacraments of the living** is the possession of the state of sanctifying grace.
- However, it is generally believed that if a person in mortal sin receives a sacrament of the living, unaware of his unworthiness and with imperfect contrition for his mortal sins, he will receive the state of grace. This is certain in regard to **Extreme Unction**, for St. says, of the sick person who receives this sacrament, `“If he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him” (James 5:15).`
- Most of the sacraments can be administered only by a **priest or a bishop**. However, two of them—**Baptism and Matrimony**—can be administered by laymen, as we shall see in the lessons on these sacraments. The Holy Eucharist can be consecrated by no one except a priest; but after it is consecrated, one who is not a priest can administer it. Ordinarily the Church allows only priests and (under certain conditions) deacons to give Holy Communion, but in extraordinary circumstances even a lay-person would be permitted to administer the Blessed Sacrament. Thus, any Catholic could consume the Holy Eucharist or give it to another Catholic, if this were necessary to prevent it from being profaned; and if no priest could be had, and the Blessed Sacrament were available, a layman would be allowed to administer Holy Communion as **Viaticum** to one in danger of death.
- Sometimes a priest administers a sacrament **conditionally**—that is, with the intention of conferring it only on condition that certain circumstances of which he is uncertain, are present. Thus, if a priest, baptizing a baby, is not certain whether or not the child has been previously baptized, he administers the sacrament with the condition: "If you are not baptized." If a priest, called to a person who has been seriously injured, is not sure whether or not the person is still living, he gives Extreme Unction with the condition: "If you are alive."
- Our Lord Himself instituted the seven sacraments for our sanctification, but the Church has instituted various rites and ceremonies for the administration of the sacraments, to manifest more clearly their significance and to impress us more deeply with their holiness.

### RESOLUTION:

- Resolve to be **reverent and devout** toward the sacraments, and never to receive them carelessly or through routine; above all, resolve never to be guilty of the grave sacrilege of receiving a sacrament unworthily.

## Lesson 24: Baptism `(Bí tích Rửa Tội)`

### Q. 315. What is baptism?

**A.** Baptism is the sacrament that gives our souls the new life of sanctifying grace by which we become children of God and heirs of heaven.

- Our adoption as sons of God through sanctifying grace is more perfect than human adoption whereby children are adopted by foster parents. In human adoption nothing is given to the foster son that makes him similar to the foster parent. Into the souls of the adopted sons of God, however, sanctifying grace is infused, which gives them supernaturally a likeness to God. In human adoption the foster son succeeds to his inheritance only after the death of the father; in God's adoption the eternally living Father lets us share in our inheritance at the time of the adoption, that is, when the sacrament of Baptism is administered. By means of sanctifying grace received in Baptism we are spiritually reborn; we become members of the family of God, who becomes our Father in the supernatural order.
- The Baptism preached by Saint did not have the same power as the Baptism instituted by Christ. The Baptism instituted by Christ directly produces grace; the Baptism preached by Saint was intended to arouse in souls sorrow for sin. The Baptism of St. prepared the way for the Baptism of Christ. After His Resurrection, Christ commanded all to receive Baptism as a necessary condition for salvation.

> `"All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and behold, I am with you all days, even unto the consummation of the world" (Matthew 28:18-20).`

> `"And he preached, saying, 'One mightier than I is coming after me, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loose. I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit' " (Mark 1:6-8).`

> `"Go into the whole world and preach the gospel to every creature. He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who does not believe shall be condemned" (Mark 16:15-16).`

> `"But to as many as received him he gave the power of becoming sons of God" (John 1:12).`

> `"Amen, amen, I say to thee, unless a man be born again of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" (John 3:5).`

> `"Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" (Acts 2:38).`

> `"For whoever are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. Now you have not received a spirit of bondage so as to be again in fear, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons, by virtue of which we cry 'Abba Father!' The Spirit himself gives testimony to our spirit that we are sons of God. But if we are sons, we are heirs also: heirs indeed of God and joint heirs with Christ, provided, however, we suffer with him that we may also be glorified with him" (Romans 8:14-17).`

> `"But when the goodness and kindness of God our Savior appeared, then not by reason of good works that we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us through the bath of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit; whom he has abundantly poured out upon us through Jesus Christ our Savior, in order that, justified by his grace, we may be heirs in the hope of life everlasting" (Titus 3:4-7).`

#### Baptism

- The baptism of Jesus Christ, which is shown in the middle, demonstrates the effect that baptism produces in us. When Our Lord was baptized by St. the Baptist in the waters of the Jordan, the voice of God the Father was heard, saying:

> `"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." (St. Matthew 3:17)`

- The Holy Spirit descended upon Him in the form of a dove, and the heavens were opened. When we are baptized, God adopts us as His children. The Holy Spirit descends upon us by His grace, and we become heirs of the kingdom of heaven.
- At the bottom is a priest baptizing an infant. An angel is holding the white robe with which the baptized child is being clothed. This garment signifies that his soul is adorned with grace and innocence that makes him beautiful and pleasing in the eyes of God.
- A child who dies as soon as he is baptized goes immediately to heaven. This is shown at the top right, where the soul of a child who died after baptism is carried to heaven by angels.
- Baptism is so necessary for salvation that even children cannot enter heaven if they are unbaptized. This is why, at the top on the left, the soul of a dead unbaptized child heads for a place where it will be deprived of celestial happiness forever. The child will, however, enjoy a natural state of happiness since it was never guilty of actual sin.

### Q. 316. What sins does Baptism take away?

**A.** Baptism takes away original sin; and also actual sins and all the punishment due to them, if the person baptized is guilty of any actual sins and truly sorry for them.

- Baptism takes away both the eternal punishment of hell due to unforgiven mortal sin, and the temporal punishment on earth or in purgatory due to venial sin or to forgive mortal sin.
- Though Baptism takes away original sin and restores sanctifying grace to the soul, it does not take away all the consequences of original sin. For example, it does not take away death, suffering, ignorance, and a strong inclination to sin.

> `"Get up and be baptized and wash away thy sins, calling on his name" (Acts 22:16).`

> `"Do you not know that all we who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into his death? ... For he who is dead is acquitted of sin. But if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live together with Christ" (Romans 6:3, 7-8).`

> `"There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus" (Romans 8:1).`

> *`See Scripture, question 315, John 3:5; Acts 2:38.`*

### Q. 317. What are the effects of the character imprinted on the soul by Baptism?

**A.** The effects of the character imprinted on the soul by Baptism are that we become members of the Church, subject to its laws, and capable of receiving the other sacraments.

- Baptized persons remain members of the Church as long as they are united to it by profession of the same faith and have not broken the bonds of communion with it.
- All validly baptized persons are subjects of the Church, even if they are not members. Hence they are obliged to obey the laws of the Church unless exempted. If, however, they are invincibly ignorant of their obligation to obey the laws of the Church, they do not sin by not obeying them. An unbaptized person cannot validly receive the other sacraments.
- A baptized person renounces Satan, his works, and his pomps, and has the obligation of leading a Christian life by following Christ and by obeying the legitimate pastors of the Church, especially the Roman Pontiff.

> *`See Scripture, question 314, 2 Corinthians 1:21-22; question 315, John 1:12, 3:5.`*

### Q. 318. Who can administer Baptism?

**A.** The priest is the usual minister of Baptism, but if there is danger that someone will die without Baptism, anyone else may and should baptize.

- In case of necessity even a heretic or an unbaptized person can validly and licitly baptize. He must, however, perform the ceremony correctly and have the intention of "doing what the Church does," namely, of performing the ceremony that is usual among Catholics.

### Q. 319. How would you give Baptism?

**A.** I would give Baptism by pouring ordinary water on the forehead of the person to be baptized, saying while pouring it: "I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost."

- By the command of Christ, real water must be used in Baptism. Thus, anything that is not water in the usual sense of the word cannot be used. In solemn Baptism, baptismal water, blessed for the purpose, must be used under penalty of grave sin.
- In Baptism conferred at home by necessity, it is best to use ordinary water. Holy water, however, may be used. If for any reason the ceremonies of Baptism are omitted, these ceremonies are to be later supplied in church.
- The sacrament of Baptism may be validly administered: first, by immersion; second, by pouring; third, by sprinkling. Christ commanded Baptism by water; He did not prescribe the manner of applying water. According to Church law, however, it is not now licit to confer Baptism by the method of sprinkling.
- In conferring Baptism by pouring, care must be taken that the water flows over the skin of the person's head, and that the words are clearly and exactly spoken while the water is being poured, not before or after the water is poured. In Baptism, the pouring of the water and the saying of the words must be done by the same person.
- If in case of necessity a person's head cannot be baptized, the water may be poured on another part of the body, preferably the chest or shoulders, since this Baptism is probably valid. If a person baptized in one of these ways can later be baptized on the forehead, this should be done, with the condition, "If you are not baptized, I baptize," etc.

> `"Now they who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls" (Acts 2:41).`

> `"These in times past had been disobedient when the patience of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was building. In that ark a few, that is, eight souls were saved through water. Its counterpart, Baptism, now saves you also" (1 Peter 3:20-21).`

> *`See Scripture, question 315, Matthew 28:18-20; John 3:5.`*

### Q. 320. Why is Baptism necessary for the salvation of all men?

**A.** Baptism is necessary for the salvation of all men because Christ has said: "Unless a man be born again of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."

- Today, many of the sects, renewing the ancient heresy of the Pelagians, reject Christ's words concerning the necessity of Baptism and seek to establish their own norms of salvation

> *`See Scripture, question 315, John 3:5; Mark 16:15-16.`*

### Q. 321. How can those be saved who through no fault of their own have not received the sacrament of Baptism?

**A.** Those who through no fault of their own have not received the sacrament of Baptism can be saved through what is called baptism of blood or baptism of desire.

### Q. 322. How does an unbaptized person receive the baptism of blood?

**A.** An unbaptized person receives the baptism of blood when he suffers martyrdom for the faith of Christ.

- Baptism of blood does not imprint a character on the soul, nor does it give one the right to receive the other sacraments. It does, however, confer grace and take away sin, original and actual, and the punishment due to sin.
- Martyrdom is the suffering, from a supernatural motive, of death or a mortal wound inflicted out of hatred for Christ, His religion, or a Christian virtue. In sinners guilty of mortal sin, at least attrition is also required in order to secure the effects of baptism of blood.

> `"He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake, will find it" (Matthew 10:39).`

### Q. 323. How does an unbaptized person receive the baptism of desire?

**A.** An unbaptized person receives the baptism of desire when he loves God above all things and desires to do all that is necessary for his salvation.

- Baptism of desire takes away all sin, original and actual, and the eternal punishment due to sin. It does not, however, imprint a character on the soul, nor does it necessarily take away all the temporal punishment due to actual sins. In baptism of desire there need not always be an explicit desire to receive baptism of water.

### Q. 324. When should children be baptized?

**A.** Children should be baptized as soon as possible after birth.

- Children should be baptized as soon as possible because Baptism is necessary for salvation. Infants who die without baptism of any kind do not suffer the punishments of those who die in mortal sin. They may enjoy a certain natural happiness, but they will not enjoy the supernatural happiness of heaven. Except in danger of death, Baptism may not be administered to a child who has not attained the use of reason and whose non-Catholic parents are unwilling to have it baptized.

### Q. 325. What sin do Catholic parents commit who put off for a long time, or entirely neglect, the Baptism of their children?

**A.** Catholic parents who put off for a long time, or entirely neglect, the Baptism of their children, commit a mortal sin.

### Q. 326. What do we promise through our godparents in Baptism?

**A.** We promise through our godparents in Baptism to renounce the devil and to live according to the teachings of Christ and of His Church.

### Q. 327. Why is the name of a saint given in Baptism?

**A.** The name of a saint is given in Baptism in order that the person baptized may imitate his virtues and have him for a protector.

### Q. 328. What is the duty of a godparent after Baptism?

**A.** The duty of a godparent after Baptism is to see that the child is brought up a good Catholic, if this is not done by the parents.

- Godparents develop a spiritual relationship, not with each other, but with their godchildren. Godparents cannot marry their godchildren without a dispensation.

### Q. 329. Who should be chosen as godparents for Baptism?

**A.** Only Catholics who know their faith and live up to the duties of their religion should be chosen as godparents for Baptism.

- Godparents should be at least thirteen years of age. Non-Catholics cannot be godparents, nor can the father, the mother, the husband, or the wife of the person to be baptized.

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT BAPTISM

- The beginning of man's earthly life takes place at birth; the beginning of his spiritual life takes place at Baptism. It was under the figure of a spiritual birth that Our Lord spoke of Baptism, when He said: "Unless a man be born again of water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" (, 5). Through Baptism one begins to live the divine life of a child of God.
- Our Lord Himself received a baptism from St. the Baptist, but this ceremony was not a sacrament. It was only a foreshadowing of the sacrament. However, it was probably about this time that Our Saviour instituted the sacrament; and perhaps administered it to the apostles with His own hands. At any rate, they must have been baptized before the Last Supper, for they then became priests, and the character of the priesthood can be given only to one who possesses the character of Baptism. Before His Ascension into heaven Christ deputed the apostles to go and baptize all men; and on Pentecost Sunday the apostles began the task, telling those who heard the Gospel and were converted: "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" (Acts, 2, 38). As the apostles went to various lands and made converts, they announced the reception of Baptism as the chief condition of becoming a follower of Christ and a member of His Church. In the words of St. Paul: "All you who have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ" (Gal. 3, 27) ... "We were all baptized into one body" (I Cor. 12, 13).
- The Catholic Church has always emphasized the importance of Baptism, and has always taken the greatest care that no child departs from this world without receiving this sacrament. The children of non-Catholics can lawfully be baptized even against the wishes of their parents, if they are in danger of death, for this sacrament is necessary for salvation, and in such a case the right of the child to eternal salvation takes precedence over parental rights.
- The child of Catholic parents should be baptized soon after birth-if possible, within two weeks. In the event that the child is in danger of death, it should be baptized immediately, in the way described in this lesson. A lay person who baptizes a child in such circumstances should not make the validity of the sacrament depend on a future condition-for example, he should not intend to give the sacrament only on condition that the priest does not come in time but should have the intention of baptizing absolutely and unconditionally. When a child has been baptized privately, it should afterward be brought to the church in order that the various ceremonies of solemn Baptism may be supplied.
- The essential ceremony of Baptism is the washing of the recipient with water. Our Saviour prescribed this washing in a general way, but He did not designate the particular mode in which it is to be performed. Hence at different times the Church has used different modes. In the beginning complete immersion was practiced, and this is still used in the Oriental rites. The Latin Church commonly employs the method of pouring, or infusion; and even sprinkling the baptismal water is a valid way of baptizing, provided the water touches the skin of the recipient's head and flows over it. The words required for Baptism, pronounced by the minister, explain what is being done- "I baptize thee"-then the words assert that the power of the sacrament comes from the three divine Persons- "in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost". To these divinely established elements of the sacrament the Church has added many beautiful ceremonies for the solemn administration of Baptism, which can be performed only by a priest or (as an extraordinary minister) a deacon, such as the anointing of the breast and shoulders with oil and the giving of a lighted candle. Catholics should study the meaning of these ceremonies, particularly if they are invited to serve as godparents at Baptism.

### RESOLUTION

- Resolve to find out the date of your Baptism and to celebrate it each year as your spiritual birthday, especially by receiving Holy Communion in thanksgiving to God for the grace of Baptism, and by renewing the promises made in your name at Baptism, to be faithful to Christ and to His Church.

## Lesson 25: Confirmation `(Bí tích Thêm Sức)`

### Q. 330. What is Confirmation?

**A.** Confirmation is the sacrament through which the Holy Ghost comes to us in a special way and enables us to profess our faith as strong and perfect Christians and soldiers of Jesus Christ.

- The word "confirmation" means "a strengthening." We are not certain from Sacred Scripture of the exact time and circumstances of the institution of Confirmation. We do know, however, that Christ instituted the sacrament before He ascended into heaven, because it is clearly evident in the New Testament that the apostles administered this sacrament.
- A confirmed person is called a soldier of Christ because, through Confirmation, he is especially deputed to profess the faith strongly and to fight for it.

> `"He who believes in me, as the Scripture says,' "from within him there shall flow rivers of living water.' " He said this, however, of the Spirit whom they who believed in him were to receive; for the Spirit had not yet been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified" (John 7:38-39).`

> `"But I speak the truth to you; it is expedient for you that I depart. For if I do not go, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you" (John 16:7).`

> `"And when the days of Pentecost were drawing to a close, they were all together in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a violent wind blowing, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. And there appeared to them parted tongues as of fire, which settled upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in foreign tongues, even as the Holy Spirit prompted them to speak" (Acts 2:1-4).`

> `"Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter"`

> `"On hearing this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus; and when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they began to speak in tongues and to prophesy" (Acts 19:5-6).`

### Q. 331. Who is the usual minister of Confirmation?

**A.** The bishop is the usual minister of Confirmation.

- Pastors and administrators of parishes, in virtue of a decree that became effective January 1, 1947, are granted the faculty of confirming, as extraordinary ministers, those among their faithful and others in their territory who are in danger of death from sickness, accident, or old age.
- Priests, especially those in missionary lands, are sometimes delegated by the Holy Father to administer Confirmation. Most priests of the Oriental Church have this privilege.

> *`See Scripture, question 330, Acts 8:14-16.`*

### Q. 332. What does the bishop do when he gives Confirmation?

**A.** The bishop extends his hands over those who are to be confirmed, prays that they may receive the Holy Ghost, and, while laying his hand on the head of each person, anoints the forehead with holy chrism in the form of a cross.

> *`See Scripture, question 330, Acts 8:14-16; Acts 19:5-6.`*

### Q. 333. What does the bishop say in anointing the person he confirms?

**A.** In anointing the person he confirms, the bishop says: "I sign thee with the sign of the cross and I confirm thee with the chrism of salvation, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost."

- The words, "I sign thee with the sign of the cross," designate the character by which the confirmed person becomes a soldier of Christ. The words, "I confirm thee," etc., designate the gift of strength received in this sacrament.

> *`See Scripture, question 330, Acts 8:14-16.`*

### Q. 334. What is holy chrism?

**A.** Holy chrism is a mixture of olive oil and balm, blessed by the bishop on Holy Thursday.

- Olive oil was formerly used to condition and strengthen the limbs of athletes. The olive oil in holy chrism signifies the strengthening grace of the Holy Spirit received in the sacrament.
- Balm, sometimes used as a preservative, is a fragrant substance derived from the balsam tree. In holy chrism it signifies the sweetness of virtue and freedom from the corruption of sin.

### Q. 335. What does the anointing of the forehead with chrism in the form of a cross signify?

**A.** The anointing of the forehead with chrism in the form of a cross signifies that the Catholic who is confirmed must always be ready to profess his faith openly and to practice it fearlessly.

### Q. 336. Why does the bishop give the person he confirms a slight blow on the cheek?

**A.** The bishop gives the person he confirms a slight blow on the cheek to remind him that he must be ready to suffer everything, even death, for the sake of Christ.

### Q. 337. What are the effects of Confirmation?

**A.** Confirmation increases sanctifying grace, gives its special sacramental grace, and imprints a lasting character on the soul.

> *`See Scripture, question 315, Acts 2:38; question 330, Acts 8:14-16; Acts 19:5-6.`*

### Q. 338. What does the sacramental grace of Confirmation help us to do?

**A.** The sacramental grace of Confirmation helps us to live our faith loyally and to profess it courageously.

- The sacramental grace of Confirmation also gives us a right to the actual graces we need when tempted against faith.

### Q. 339. What is the character of Confirmation?

**A.** The character of Confirmation is a spiritual and indelible sign that marks the Christian as a soldier in the army of Christ.

- The character of Confirmation is a quality impressed on the soul that enables us to fight spiritual battles against the enemies of the faith after the example of the apostles, who, upon receiving the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, were not afraid to profess and preach the faith to the entire world.

### Q. 340. What is necessary to receive Confirmation properly?

**A.** To receive Confirmation properly it is necessary to be in the state of grace, and to know well the chief truths and duties of our religion.

- A non-baptized person cannot receive validly the sacrament of Confirmation. In the Latin Church it is proper for children to receive Confirmation at about the age of seven. The sacrament, however, may be given at an earlier age either by reason of danger of death or for any other cause the minister considers grave and just. In the Eastern Church, children usually receive Confirmation immediately after Baptism.
- A baptized person cannot without sin neglect to receive Confirmation when the opportunity offers itself. Further, if the neglect to receive Confirmation arises from contempt for the sacrament, the sin is grave.
- A baptized person who receives Confirmation knowing that he is in the state of mortal sin, commits a grave sin of sacrilege and receives no grace. He does, however, receive the sacrament validly. If, therefore, he regains the state of grace, he will then receive the graces of Confirmation.
- The candidate for Confirmation should have a sponsor of his own sex who was not his godparent in Baptism. The sponsor must be a baptized Catholic who is confirmed. The other conditions of sponsorship are in general the same as those for godparents in Baptism.
- A spiritual relationship is contracted between the confirmed person and the sponsor. The sponsor, moreover, has the obligation of considering the confirmed person as placed under his special care and of providing, if necessary, for his Christian education. This spiritual relationship does not constitute an impediment to Matrimony.

> *`See Scripture, question 330, Acts 8:14-16; Acts 19:5-6.`*

### Q. 341. After we have been confirmed, why should we continue to study our religion even more earnestly than before?

**A.** After we have been confirmed, we should continue to study our religion even more earnestly than before, so that we may be able to explain and defend our faith, and thus co-operate with the grace of Confirmation.

### Q. 342. Why should all Catholics be confirmed?

**A.** All Catholics should be confirmed in order to be strengthened against the dangers to salvation and to be prepared better to defend their Catholic faith.

#### Confirmation

- At the top left, a soldier fights against a dragon with seven heads. This signifies that in confirmation we receive the strength necessary to conquer the seven capital sins.
- On the right is a child, faithful to the lessons of his mother, declaring himself Christian in front of a pagan judge who wanted to make him renounce the faith of Jesus Christ. This scene shows that confirmation gives us the strength to remain faithful to Jesus Christ amidst persecutions.
- In the middle, St. Peter
- The Holy Spirit is shown hovering above those who are confirmed and pouring out all His gifts upon them.
- At the bottom is a bishop who is administering confirmation to first communicants. He is preceded by his vicar-general, who gives him, one, and the names of those who are to be confirmed. He is followed by another priest holding a tray on which is the container of the Holy Chrism. A third priest wearing a surplice and stole wipes with balls of cotton the foreheads of those who have just been confirmed.

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT CONFIRMATION

- In the normal course of nature everyone who is born eventually comes to maturity-the fullness of bodily strength and vigor. So too, God wills that everyone who has been born to the spiritual life by Baptism shall come to spiritual maturity and to the fullness of spiritual strength; and for this purpose Our Divine Lord instituted a special sacrament, Confirmation. During His lifetime, and particularly at the Last Supper, Christ promised to send the Holy Ghost for the enlightenment and the strengthening of His followers. This promise was fulfilled for the apostles and the disciples on Pentecost, when the Holy Ghost descended on them in the form of fiery tongues. But the means which our Lord chose to confer this privilege on the other members of the Church was a sacrament. We find reference to this sacrament in the of the Apostles which relate that Peter
- In the beginning, this sacrament may have been conferred only by the laying on of hands; but at any rate, anointing was in use in the third or fourth century. Even today there are some differences in the manner of confirming between the Latin Church and the Oriental churches. Thus, in the former only one anointing is given, on the forehead, whereas in the latter the anointing is given on several parts of the body. Moreover, in the Oriental rites infants are usually confirmed immediately after Baptism, whereas in the Latin Church it is considered preferable to wait until children have reached the use of reason.
- In connection with the sacrament of Confirmation it is appropriate to describe the various holy oils used in the liturgical ceremonies of the Church. These oils are three in number-the oil of catechumens, holy chrism, and the oil of the sick. These are blessed by the bishop at the Solemn Mass on Holy Thursday and are then distributed as soon as possible to the pastors throughout the diocese, because the law of the Church prescribes that in the administration of the sacraments and the other sacred functions in which blessed oil is used the oil which has been blessed on the preceding Holy Thursday shall be employed. Thus, in the blessing of the baptismal water on Holy Saturday the priest must use the oil of catechumens and the chrism blessed two days before.
- The holy oils are used in the administration of four sacraments-Baptism, Confirmation, Holy Orders and Extreme Unction. In conferring Baptism, the priest anoints the breast and the back of the recipient with oil of catechumens before the pouring of the water, and his head with chrism afterward. In Confirmation, as was described in this lesson, the bishop anoints the brow of the person being confirmed with holy chrism. When a man is being ordained to the priesthood his hands are anointed with the oil of catechumens; and when a priest is being consecrated a bishop his head and hands are anointed with chrism. The oil of the sick is used for the administration of Extreme Unction.
- We cannot value too highly the importance of Confirmation in the supernatural life. It is a great source of strength in the warfare we must wage against the three great enemies of our salvation, the world, the flesh and the devil. The character of Confirmation remains on the soul forever, marking one who has been confirmed as a soldier of Christ, with the right and the duty of proclaiming and defending the Christian faith before the world. Nowadays there is a great need of those who will explain and uphold the true religion of Christ, even though it demands personal sacrifice; and this task belongs not merely to the priests and bishops but also to the laity-of course, always with due subordination to their ecclesiastical rulers. And when a lay-person, according to his capacities and position, defends and explains the faith of Christ, he is living up to the task committed to him through Confirmation and is contributing his share toward Catholic Action.
- It is evident that every Catholic should receive Confirmation in order to partake of the strengthening graces of this great sacrament. It sometimes happens that a person who, through no fault of his own, was not confirmed in his earlier years comes to maturity without having received Confirmation. Such a person should ask his pastor to arrange for his Confirmation. Even though he may not be guilty of mortal sin if he fails to receive this sacrament, he is surely depriving himself of a most effective means of spiritual light and strength.

### RESOLUTION

- If you have not yet received Confirmation resolve to prepare for this great sacrament most devoutly in the spirit of the apostles when they awaited the coming of the Holy Ghost. If you have been confirmed, resolve to make use of every opportunity in which you can prudently and effectively explain and defend your faith. Write the dates of your Baptism, your Confirmation and your First Communion in your prayer book.

- Nina, in the fifth grade got a letter yesterday from her brother, a missionary priest in the East Indies. Among other news items, Nina's brother wrote that he had confirmed 175 natives on his last missionary tour. Nina is studying Catechism No. 2, and it seems to her that only a bishop can give Confirmation. But her brother, Pius, is just a missionary priest, and not a bishop. Please clear up Nina's difficulty.
- On Holy Thursday afternoon Fr. Cletus informed Andrew, one of the altar-boys, that he was driving to the cathedral, forty miles distant, to get the holy oils. Andrew asked why Fr. Cletus could not wait until after Easter Sunday, since the roads were covered with snow. What answer do you think Fr. Cletus gave?
- Shirley, a non-Catholic girl, receives an invitation to attend the Confirmation of her friend Augusta. After the ceremony Shirley has many questions to ask her newly-confirmed friend. That night Shirley tries to repeat to her family everything Augusta explained. However, she cannot recall the name of the mixture used by the bishop. She remembers that some olive oil is in that mixture, and something else. She doesn't remember the symbolism of the two substances in the mixture. Supply the information Shirley has forgotten.
- Six months ago, Bishop James, for the first time in his life, received the last rites of the Church. He has now recovered his health. How many of the sacred oils has he received up to now? In which Sacraments were they used? Have any of these oils been used in more than one Sacrament? Explain.
- Little Stephen, two years old, is very sick, and the doctor says that he is sure to die within several days. His good Catholic parents would like to have Stephen confirmed before his death, so that he may have additional glory in heaven. But it is impossible to bring the sick child to the Bishop, whose residence is more than a hundred miles distant; and it would be unreasonable to expect the Bishop to make the long journey. Can you tell Stephen's parents how they can procure Confirmation for their little boy through an extraordinary privilege granted by Pope Pius XII, which began to be effective on January 1, 1947?
- Colin, when a boy in the sixth grade, received Confirmation unfortunately in a state of mortal sin. Now he is about to graduate.

What do you think of Walberga's suggestion? What is your opinion of Jolanda's statement?
- Lawrence, twelve years of age, was very sick when Confirmation was administered in his parish and hence could not receive it. In the course of the next few years his parents changed their abode several times, so that it was not until Lawrence was eighteen years old that he heard the announcement of an approaching Confirmation in his parish church. Lawrence is now embarrassed at the thought of receiving confirmation with little boys and girls, for he is a tall, robust young man. Will he commit a mortal sin if he refuses to be confirmed? What arguments can you give him to induce him to put aside his fears?
- Were the apostles themselves confirmed? Were they confirmed by bishops? Please explain your answers.

## Lesson 26: The Holy Eucharist `(Bí tích Thánh Thể)`

### Q. 343. What is the Holy Eucharist?

**A.** The Holy Eucharist is a sacrament and a sacrifice. In the Holy Eucharist, under the appearances of bread and wine, the Lord Christ is contained, offered, and received.

- The whole Christ is really, truly, and substantially present in the Holy Eucharist. We use the words "really, truly, and substantially" to describe Christ's presence in the Holy Eucharist in order to distinguish Our Lord's teaching from that of mere men who falsely teach that the Holy Eucharist is only a sign or figure of Christ, or that He is present only by His power.
- All Christians, with but few minor exceptions, held the true doctrine of the Real Presence from the time of Christ until the Protestant Revolution in the sixteenth century. The word "Eucharist" means "Thanksgiving."

### Q. 344. When did Christ institute the Holy Eucharist?

**A.** Christ instituted the Holy Eucharist at the Last Supper, the night before He died.

- About a year before the Last Supper Our Lord promised to give us the Holy Eucharist. This promise is related in the sixth chapter of the Gospel according to Saint John. The fulfillment of this promise took place at the Last Supper.

#### I: The Promise

> `"I am the bread of life. Your fathers ate the manna in the desert, and have died. This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that if anyone eat of it he will not die. I am the living bread that has come down from heaven. If anyone eat of this bread he shall live forever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world.'"`

> `"The Jews on that account argued with one another, saying, 'How can this man give us his flesh to eat?'"`

> `"Jesus therefore said to them, 'Amen, amen, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, you shall not have life in you. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has life everlasting and I will raise him up on the last day. For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He who eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, abides in me and me in him. As the living Father has sent me, and as I live because of the Father, so he who eats me, he also shall live because of me. This is the bread that has come down from heaven; not as your fathers ate the manna, and died. He who eats this bread shall live forever' " (John 6:48-59).`

#### II: The Institution

> `"And while they were at supper, Jesus took bread, and blessed and broke, and gave it to his disciples, and said, 'Take and eat; this is my body.' And taking a cup, he gave thanks and gave it to them, saying, 'All of you drink of this; for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is being shed for many unto the forgiveness of sins' " (Matthew 26:26-28).`

> `"And while they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessing it, he broke and gave it to them, and said, 'Take; this is my body.' And taking a cup and giving thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank of it; and he said to them, 'This is my blood of the new covenant, which is being shed for many' " (Mark 14:22-24).`

> `"And having taken bread, he gave thanks and broke, and gave it to them, saying, 'This is my body, which is being given for you; do this in remembrance of me.' In like manner he took also the cup after the supper, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which shall be shed for you' " (Luke 22:19-20).`

> `"For I myself have received from the Lord (what I also delivered to you), that the Lord Jesus, on the night in which he was betrayed, took bread, and giving thanks broke, and said, 'This is my body which shall be given up for you; do this in remembrance of me.' In like manner also the cup, after he had supped, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as you shall eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the death of the Lord, until he comes.' Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily, will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of that bread and drink of the cup; for he who eats and drinks unworthily, without distinguishing the body, eats and drinks judgment to himself" (1 Corinthians 11:23-29).`

### Q. 345. Who were present when Our Lord instituted the Holy Eucharist?

**A.** When Our Lord instituted the Holy Eucharist, the apostles were present.

> `"Now when evening arrived, he reclined at table with the twelve disciples" (Matthew 26:20).`

> `"Now when evening arrived, he came with the Twelve" (Mark 14:17).`

> `"And when the hour had come, he reclined at table, and the twelve apostles with him" (Luke 22:14).`

### Q. 346. How did Christ institute the Holy Eucharist?

**A.** Christ instituted the Holy Eucharist in this way: He took bread, blessed and broke it, and giving it to His apostles, said: "Take and eat; this is My body;" then He took a cup of wine, blessed it, and giving it to them, said: "All of you drink of this; for this is My blood of the new covenant which is being shed for many unto the forgiveness of sins;" finally, He gave His apostles the commission: "Do this in remembrance of Me."

### Q. 347. What happened when Our Lord said: "This is My body ... this is My blood?"

**A.** When Our Lord said, "This is My body," the entire substance of the bread was changed into His body; and when He said, "This is My blood," the entire substance of the wine was changed into His blood.

- Christ could not have used clearer, more explicit words than "This is My body." He did not say, "This is a sign of My body." or "This represents My body," but, "This is My body." Catholics take Christ at His word because He is the omnipotent God. On His word they know that the Holy Eucharist is the body and blood of Christ.

> *`See Scripture, question 344, Matthew 26:26-28; Mark 14:22-24; Luke 22:19-20; 1 Corinthians 11:23-29.`*

### Holy Eucharist

- In the center, Our Lord is instituting the Eucharist on Holy Thursday, the eve of His death, in the Cenacle in Jerusalem. At the top left, the treacherous apostle hangs himself from a tree after making a sacrilegious communion.
- At the bottom, a priest distributes Holy Communion to the faithful during the Mass.
- The principal effect of Communion, which is to nourish our souls spiritually, is shown at the top right in the person of the prophet Elias. An angel gives him a hearth cake and a vessel of water, saying to him:

> `"Arise and eat, for thou hast yet a great way to go." (3 Kings 19:7)`

- St. Elias got up, ate, and drank. Strengthened by this nourishment, he walked forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mountain of God. The bread of St. Elias is a figure of the Eucharist which strengthens our souls, helps us to live a holy life, and brings us to the happiness of heaven.

### Q. 348. Did anything of the bread and wine remain after their substance had been changed into Our Lord's body and blood?

**A.** After the substance of the bread and wine had been changed into Our Lord's body and blood, there remained only the appearances of bread and wine.

- Because the appearances of bread and wine remain in the Holy Eucharist, we cannot see Christ with our bodily eyes in this sacrament. We do see Him, however, with the eyes of faith. Our bodily eyes, moreover, do not deceive us when they see the appearances of bread and wine, for these appearances really remain after the Consecration of the Mass.

### Q. 349. What do we mean by the appearances of bread and wine?

**A.** By the appearances of bread and wine we mean their color, taste, weight, shape, and whatever else appears to the senses.

### Q. 350. What is the change of the entire substance of the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ called?

**A.** The change of the entire substance of the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ is called Transubstantiation.

### Q. 351. Is Jesus Christ whole and entire both under the appearances of bread and under the appearances of wine?

**A.** Jesus Christ is whole and entire both under the appearances of bread and under the appearances of wine.

- We know that Christ is whole and entire under both appearances because, "Christ having risen from the dead, dies now no more" (Romans 6:9). Because Christ cannot die, His blood must remain united always to His body, and His soul to both. The divinity of Christ, moreover, always remains united to His body and blood and soul because He is God made man.
- The whole Christ is present under each part of the sacred appearances and remains present as long as the sacred appearances remain.

> *`See Scripture, question 344, Matthew 26:26-28; Mark 14:22-24. Luke 22:19-20; 1 Corinthians 11:23-29.`*

### Q. 352. How was Our Lord able to change bread and wine into His body and blood?

**A.** Our Lord was able to change bread and wine into His body and blood by His almighty power.

- God, who created all things from nothing, who fed the five thousand with five loaves, who changed water into wine instantaneously, who raised the dead to life, can change bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ. Although the Holy Eucharist is a great mystery, and consequently beyond human understanding, the principles of sound reason can show that this great gift is not impossible by the power of God.

> `"And looking upon them, Jesus said to them, 'With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible' " (Matthew 19:26).`

> `"All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me" (Matthew 28:18).`

### Q. 353. Does this change of bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ continue to be made in the Church?

**A.** This change of bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ continues to be made in the Church by Jesus Christ, through the ministry of His priests.

- Only ordained priests have the power of changing bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ. When they consecrate, they act in the person of Christ, through the power received in the sacrament of Holy Orders.

> *`See Scripture, question 344, Luke 22:19-20; 1 Corinthians 11:23-29.`*

### Q. 354. When did Christ give His priests the power to change bread and wine into His body and blood?

**A.** Christ gave His priests the power to change bread and wine into His body and blood when He made the apostles priests at the Last Supper by saying to them: "Do this in remembrance of Me."

### Q. 355. How do priests exercise their power to change bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ?

**A.** Priests exercise their power to change bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ by repeating at the Consecration of the Mass the words of Christ: "This is My body ... this is My blood."

### Q. 356. Why does Christ give us His own body and blood in the Holy Eucharist?

**A.** Christ gives us His own body and blood in the Holy Eucharist: first, to be offered as a sacrifice commemorating and renewing for all time the sacrifice of the cross; second, to be received by the faithful in Holy Communion; third, to remain ever on our altars as the proof of His love for us, and to be worshiped by us.

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT THE HOLY EUCHARIST

- When we love someone very much, we desire to be constantly in his company. Our Divine Lord had an immeasurable love for every member of the human race, and gave proof of this by shedding His blood for the salvation of all mankind. However, after His task on earth was completed, He was destined to ascend into heaven to take His place at the right hand of His Father; and so it would seem that He could no longer associate intimately with men. But His love and power devised a means whereby He could still remain on earth, not merely in one place but in every church, and thus be the intimate companion of every one of His faithful followers. This means is the Blessed Sacrament, the Holy Eucharist, wherein Our Lord remains truly present under the appearances of bread and wine.
- The Catholic doctrine of the Holy Eucharist contains many mysteries. It is beyond our comprehension how the same living Christ who is in heaven should also be on earth, in every place where the Holy Eucharist is consecrated. We cannot understand how the body of our Saviour with its full stature can be present beneath the small host. We cannot attempt to explain how our Divine Redeemer can be present, whole and entire, in the smallest portions of the consecrated species of bread and wine, although we have some resemblance to this miracle in the presence of our entire soul in every portion of our body. But we have the statement of Our Lord Himself for the truth of these mysteries, and hence it is our duty to believe them without hesitation. When Our Saviour first announced the doctrine of the Holy Eucharist to His followers, some of them would not believe. They said: "This is a hard saying, who can listen to it?" (John, 6, 62), and some of them even left Him forever. Today there are many persons in the world who say that the doctrine of the Real Presence is too hard to believe, and claim that the Eucharist is only bread and wine representing Christ. But Catholics accept the words of Our Lord Himself who said: "This is my body ... this is my blood," and adore Him as truly present in the Holy Eucharist.
- The Holy Eucharist is the very **center of Catholic worship**, the **heart of Catholic life**. Because the Church believes that the Son of God is truly present in the Blessed Sacrament, she erects beautiful cathedrals and adorns them with exquisite sculpture and priceless paintings. The most magnificent liturgical ceremonies of the Catholic Church are directed toward honoring the King of kings, who for the love of mankind dwells beneath the appearances of bread and wine. Music and lights and incense and flowers the Church uses lavishly in her desire to show fitting honor to the Son of God, dwelling in our midst. Twice a year the Church celebrates in a special manner the great privilege of the Real Presence of Jesus Christ in the Holy Eucharist. On **Holy Thursday** the Church recalls to our minds the institution of the Blessed Sacrament by Our Divine Lord on the night before His death. But since our predominant sentiment in Holy Week is sorrow, the Church has assigned another day, the Thursday after Trinity Sunday, to be the **Feast of Corpus Christi**, when with sentiments of unrestrained joy we thank Our Saviour for the wonderful gift of the Holy Eucharist. Moreover, it is customary to have annually in every parish church the **Forty Hours' Devotion**, when Our Lord is enthroned in the monstrance for a period of almost three days. The purpose of **Eucharistic Congresses**, bringing together Catholics from all parts of the earth, is to give glory and praise to Christ in the Holy Eucharist.
- Every loyal Catholic should be in harmony with the Church in expressing his devotion toward the Holy Eucharist in a fitting manner. The first sentiment of our hearts toward Our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament should be profound **adoration**, for even in His human nature Jesus Christ is a divine person, worthy of the highest form of worship. Our next sentiment should be ardent **love**. It was out of love for us that He established this wondrous sacrament; in return He asks our love. We can testify our love for the Holy Eucharist in many ways-Mass, Holy Communion, visits to Our Lord in the tabernacle. Whenever we enter a church in which the Blessed Sacrament is kept our first thought should be: "Our loving Lord is present here just as truly as He was present in the little house of Nazareth when He dwelt on earth nineteen centuries ago."

### RESOLUTION

- Resolve to learn and to use some short prayers in honor of the Holy Eucharist, such as: "O Sacrament most holy, O Sacrament divine, all praise and all thanksgiving be every moment thine" and "May the Heart of Jesus, in the Most Blessed Sacrament be praised, adored and loved with grateful affection at every moment in all the tabernacles of the world even to the end of time. Amen."

#### B. PROBLEMS AND EXERCISES.

*(Answer the questions orally or write them as your teacher may direct):*

- Gertrude, on her way to the children's Mass, at which she intends to receive Holy Communion, passes a Protestant Church. The bulletin board in front of the church advertises the Lord's Supper service at 11:00 a.m. every Sunday morning. Is Gertrude on her way to "The Lord's Supper" in her church?
- Jessie, a Protestant neighbor of Gertrude, goes to that "Lord's Supper" service at 11:00 a.m. the same morning. Have Gertrude and Jessie both received the same great Gift? Explain the difference, if any.
- Hubert notices that the Church celebrates two special feasts of the Blessed Sacrament during the year, and neither of them falls on a Sunday, What are those feasts, and what do they commemorate? On what day of the week do they occur? Why?
- Hilary is passing through a strange town on Sunday morning. He enters what appears to be a Catholic Church. He looks for the sign that customarily indicates the Real Presence. What is that sign? What is the Real Presence?
- Felix, a new altar-boy, is instructed by the pastor to hold the Communion paten (plate) level-in a horizontal position-and to be careful not to tilt it, or touch it to the chins or clothing of the communicants. Why does the pastor instruct Felix in this way? Felix notices a small, tiny piece of a Sacred Host on the plate he is carrying. The priest afterwards carefully brushes It into the chalice. Why?
- Gladys would like to know when the apostles received their First Holy Communion.
- At the Consecration in the Mass, the priest leans on the altar and speaks certain words over the bread in his hands and again over the wine in the chalice he is holding; next, he bends his right knee to the ground, then elevates, first the Host, and next the Chalice, and finally repeats the genuflection. Which of the above enumerated actions are the most important? Why?
- Lucille, a cultured little pagan girl, whose parents are not churchgoers, learned from Joyce, her Catholic playmate, that Our Lord is present within our tabernacles. She seems pleased with her newly acquired knowledge, but is a bit mystified to know how Our Lord can be in thousands of tabernacles throughout the United States, and all over the world at one and the same time. Joyce tells Lucille that we cannot understand how that can be; we take Our Lord's word for it that it is so; but she gives an illustration from the modern wonders of worldwide hookups over the radio and television that helps Lucille in her difficulty. How would you express the same illustration?
- Bernard has the habit of burying his head in his left arm at the elevations in the Mass, while he thumps his breast resoundingly with his right fist as the altar-boy rings the bells. Make a comment of not less than 15 words and not more than 30 on this particular habit of Bernard.
- Does Our Lord ask us to understand HOW He can be present in the Blessed Sacrament, or to believe THAT He is present therein? Explain your answer in three or four sentences.
- To pay honor to the Blessed Eucharist, periodically the faithful assemble in devotional gatherings that are sometimes regional in character, at others, national, and still others, international. What are these meetings called? Where was the last international one held? When?
- What annual devotion, extending usually over three days, is conducted in every parish of our country as a tribute of love and reparation to the Blessed Eucharist?
- What is the center of Catholic worship, the heart of Catholic life?
- Name three ways of showing appreciation for the immense treasure we have in the Blessed Sacrament.

## Lesson 27: The Sacrifice of the Mass `(Hy Lễ Thánh Lễ)`

### Q. 357. What is the Mass?

**A.** The Mass is the Sacrifice of the New Law in which Christ, through the ministry of the priest, offers Himself to God in an unbloody manner under the appearances of bread and wine.

- The name "**Mass**" comes from the Latin word *Missa* meaning **dismissal**. In the early days of the Church the catechumens were asked to leave after the gospel and sermon were finished. The faithful, however, remained until they were dismissed after the sacrifice was completed. Then, as now, this was done by saying or singing *Ite Missa Est*. In the course of time the word *Missa*, or dismissal, was used to designate the entire sacrifice.

> `"I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of hosts: and I will not receive a gift of your hand. For from the rising of the sun even to the going down, my name is great among the Gentiles: and in every place there is sacrifice and there is offered to my name a clean oblation" (Malachias 1:10-11).`

> `"Therefore, beloved, flee from the worship of idols. I am speaking as to men of sense; judge for yourselves what I say. The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not the sharing of the blood of Christ? And the bread that we break, is it not the partaking of the body of the Lord? Because the bread is one, we though many, are one body, all of us who partake of the one bread. Behold Israel according to the flesh, are not they who eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar? What then do I say? That what is sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? No; but I say that what the Gentiles sacrifice, 'they sacrifice to devils and not to God'; and I would not have you become associates of devils. You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils; you cannot be partakers of the table of the Lord and of the table of devils. Or are we provoking the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?" (1 Corinthians 10:14-22).`

> `"We have an altar, from which they have no right to eat who serve the tabernacle" (Hebrews 13:10).`

> *`See Scripture, question 344, Matthew 26:26-28; Mark 14:22-24; Luke 22:19-20; 1 Corinthians 11:23-29.`*

### Q. 358. What is a sacrifice?

**A.** A sacrifice is the offering of a victim by a priest to God alone, and the destruction of it in some way to acknowledge that He is the Creator of all things.

- By his very nature man wants to adore and thank his Creator. Men mistaken at times about the nature of the true God have offered false worship; but they have always recognized the obligation of adoring the Supreme Being. As far back as the history of man is recorded, there is evidence that men acknowledged their dependence on the Supreme Being by offering sacrifices to Him.
- Before the coming of Christ, sacrifices were offered to God in many different ways. The patriarchs and Jewish priests at the command of God offered fruits, wine, or animals as victims. Cain, for example, offered fruits; Abel offered some sheep of his flock; Melchisedech offered bread and wine. The **destruction** of these offerings removed them from man's use and thereby signified that God is the Supreme Lord and Master of the entire created universe and that man is wholly dependent upon Him for everything. Sacrifice, therefore, is the most perfect way for man to worship God.
- All these different sacrifices of the Old Law were only figures of the sacrifice that Christ was to make of Himself. His offering of Himself on the cross was the greatest sacrifice ever offered to God. All the sacrifices of the Old Law derived their efficacy, or value, from the sacrifice which Christ was to offer on the cross.

> *`See Scripture, question 357, Malachias 1:10-11.`*

### Q. 359. Who is the principal priest in every Mass?

**A.** The principal priest in every Mass is Jesus Christ, who offers to His heavenly Father, through the ministry of His ordained priest, His body and blood which were sacrificed on the cross.

- The Mass is the **same sacrifice** as the sacrifice of the cross. It is now, in the New Law, the sacrifice that is acceptable to God.

> *`See Scripture, question 344, Matthew 26:26-28; Luke 22:19-20.`*

### Q. 360. Why is the Mass the same sacrifice as the sacrifice of the cross?

**A.** The Mass is the same sacrifice as the sacrifice of the cross because in the Mass the victim is the same, and the principal priest is the same, Jesus Christ.

- Christ, though invisible, is the principal minister, offering Himself in the Mass. The priest is the visible and secondary minister, offering Christ in the Mass. The most important part of the Mass is the **Consecration**. In the Consecration bread and wine are changed into the body and blood of Christ, who then is really present on the altar. Through the priest He offers Himself to God in commemoration of His death on the cross.
- The other most important parts of the Mass are the **Offertory** and the **Communion**. In the Offertory the priest offers to God the bread and wine that will be changed into the body and blood of Christ. In the Communion the priest and the people receive the body and blood of Our Lord under the appearances of bread and wine.

> `"And Jesus cried out with a loud voice and said, 'Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.' And having said this, he expired" (Luke 23:46).`

> *`See Scripture, question 344, Luke 22:19-20.`*

### Q. 361. What are the purposes for which the Mass is offered?

**A.** The purposes for which the Mass is offered are: first, to adore God as our Creator and Lord; second, to thank God for His many favors; third, to ask God to bestow His blessings on all men; fourth, to satisfy the justice of God for the sins committed against Him.

- In every Mass **adoration, praise and thanksgiving** are given to God and **reparation** is made to Him.
- Besides the purpose for which the Mass is offered and the effects that it produces, there are also special **fruits of the Mass**. The fruits of the Mass are the blessings that God bestows through the Mass upon the celebrant, upon those who serve or assist at it, upon the person or persons for whom it is offered, and also upon all mankind, especially the members of the Church and the souls in purgatory. The measure of these blessings depends especially on the dispositions of those to whom they are given.

> *`See Scripture, question 360, Luke 23:46.`*

### Q. 362. Is there any difference between the sacrifice of the cross and the Sacrifice of the Mass?

**A.** The manner in which the sacrifice is offered is different. On the cross Christ physically shed His blood and was physically slain, while in the Mass there is no physical shedding of blood or physical death, because Christ can die no more; on the cross Christ gained merit and satisfied for us, while in the Mass He applies to us the merits and satisfaction of His death on the cross.

- On the cross Christ was offered in a **bloody manner**; in the Mass He is offered in an **unbloody manner**. On the cross Christ alone offered Himself directly; in the Mass He offers Himself through the priest, who is the secondary but true minister, dependent upon Christ.
- On the cross Christ suffered and died; in the Mass He can no longer suffer or die. On the cross He paid the price of our redemption; in the Mass He applies to us the merits of His Sacrifice on the cross.
- There are various kinds of Masses: first, a **Solemn Mass**, which is celebrated by a priest who is immediately assisted by a deacon and a subdeacon; second, a **High Mass**, in which the celebrating priest sings certain parts of the Mass; third, a **Low Mass**, in which the priest reads all the parts of the Mass: fourth, a **Pontifical Mass**, which is celebrated by a bishop and by certain other prelates.
- Any of these kinds of Masses can be a **Requiem Mass**, which is one offered for the dead. In a Requiem Mass the celebrating priest wears black vestments and reads or chants special prayers for the dead.
- Some prayers make up the "**Ordinary**" of the Mass and are practically always the same; others make up the "**Proper**" of the Mass and differ according to the seasons and the feasts of the ecclesiastical calendar. Ordinarily Mass must be offered on an altar stone consecrated by a bishop or by his delegate.
- The priest wears the following **vestments** during Mass: first, the **amice**, a white linen cloth placed over the shoulders and about the neck; second, the **Alb**, a long white linen garment covering the body; third, the **cincture**, a cord tied about the waist; fourth, the **maniple**, a short band of cloth hanging from the left arm; fifth, the **stole**, a long narrow band of cloth worn over the shoulders and crossed in front of the body; and sixth, the **chasuble**, an outer garment covering the greater part of the body.
- These vestments have an ancient origin, and most of them resemble the garments worn by the apostles.
- The **colors** of the outer vestments worn during Mass are: **white**, which signifies purity of soul and holiness; **red**, which signifies the shedding of blood and burning love; **green**, which signifies hope; **violet**, which signifies penance; **black**, which signifies mourning; **rose**, which signifies joy in the midst of penance; and **gold**, which is used on solemn occasions in place of white, red, or green vestments.
- White vestments are worn on feasts of Our Lord, the Blessed Virgin, saints who were not martyrs, and during the Easter season; red is used on the feasts of the Holy Ghost, the passion of Our Lord, and martyrs; green is used on the Sundays outside of Advent, Lent, and the Christmas and Easter season; violet is worn in Lent, Advent, and on penitential days; black is worn in Masses for the dead; rose may be used instead of violet on the third Sunday of Advent and on the fourth Sunday of Lent.
- Some of the important **articles** used during Mass are: the **chalice**, or gold-lined cup, in which the wine is consecrated; the **paten**, or gold covered plate, on which the host is placed; the **purificator**, or cloth, for wiping the chalice; the **pall**, or linen-covered card, used to cover the chalice; the **corporal**, or square linen cloth, on which the host is placed; the **missal**, or book, from which the priest reads the prayers of the Mass; the beeswax candles; the crucifix over the altar; and the three linen cloths that cover the altar.

> `"For we know that Christ, having risen from the dead, dies now no more, death shall no longer have dominion over him. For the death that he died, he died to sin once for all, but the life that he lives, he lives unto God" (Romans 6:9-10).`

> `"For Jesus has not entered into a Holies made by hands, a mere copy of the true, but into heaven itself, to appear now before the face of God on our behalf; nor yet has he entered to offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the Holies year after year with blood not his own; for in that case he must have suffered often since the beginning of the world" (Hebrews 9:24-26).`

### Q. 363. How should we assist at Mass?

**A.** We should assist at Mass with reverence, attention, and devotion.

- There are different ways of assisting at Mass devoutly: using the **missal** to follow the priest, saying the **Mass prayers** as found in a prayer book, reciting the **Rosary**, or singing **hymns**.

### Q. 364. What is the best method of assisting at Mass?

**A.** The best method of assisting at Mass is to unite with the priest in offering the Holy Sacrifice, and to receive Holy Communion.

- It is evident from the words of the priest himself that we do unite with him in offering up the Holy Sacrifice. After the Offertory he turns to the people and says: "Pray, brethren, that **my sacrifice and yours** may be acceptable to God the Father Almighty." In the second commemoration of the Canon of the Mass he says: "Remember, O Lord, Thy servants ... , for whom we offer, or **who offer up to Thee, this sacrifice of praise** ... ."

### Q. 365. Who said the first Mass?

**A.** Our divine Savior said the first Mass, at the Last Supper, the night before He died.

> *`See Scripture, question 344.`*

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT THE SACRIFICE OF THE MASS

- Man naturally seeks some way of showing externally his **adoration and gratitude** toward His Creator. From the beginning of time the method by which men most clearly manifested their reverence toward God has been by the ceremony of **sacrifice**. By this ceremony man takes a creature-for example, an animal, or a cup of wine-and makes a gift of it to God. This is an expressive way of saying that God is the Lord of all created things. Also implied in this offering is man's acknowledgement that God gives him everything he has, and so he thanks the Almighty for His favors in the past and begs Him to continue His favors in the future. Then the offering is destroyed-for example, the animal is killed, or the wine is poured out. This too has a symbolic meaning. It signifies that man confesses that he has sinned, and deserves to be punished by God, and by this ceremony he implores pardon. Thus, the purposes of every sacrifice are four-**adoration, gratitude, petition, and atonement** for sin and for its punishments. Sacrifice is a public act-that is, it is offered by a group or society, through their representative, an official known as a **priest**.
- There are many references to sacrifices in the Old Testament. Cain and Abel, the sons of our first parents offered sacrifices, the former of the fruits of the earth, the latter some of the sheep of his flock. Noah offered a sacrifice on leaving the Ark. **Melchisedech offered a sacrifice of bread and wine** on meeting Abraham. God Himself prescribed many forms of sacrifice for the Jewish people. However, all these sacrifices were but preparations for the great sacrifice that was to be offered on **Calvary**, the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the sacrifice of which He was both priest and victim. As St. Paul says: "At the end of the ages. He has appeared for the destruction of sin by the sacrifice of Himself" (*Hebr.*, 9, 26) The sacrifice of Himself which Our Lord offered was of infinite worth, because of the infinite dignity of the priest and victim, and so it gave infinite praise and adoration to God, and was capable of satisfying for the sins of all mankind.
- However, Our Lord wished that the sacrifice of Calvary should not be limited to one place or one time. He willed that all men should have an opportunity of assisting at the sacrifice of His body and blood. And so, on the night before His death He established the **Sacrifice of the Mass**. This was to be a **renewal of Calvary**, in the sense that the same body and blood that were offered on the cross were to be offered again. There was to be no new death of Our Saviour; but His death was to be represented vividly by the **twofold consecration** of the bread into His body and the wine into His blood, typifying the separation of body and blood that actually took place on Calvary. This sacrifice was to **apply to the souls of men the merits and satisfaction** which Our Saviour earned by His death. It was this sacrifice, the Mass, which God through the prophet announced, more than four centuries before Christ: "From the rising of the sun even to the going down, my name is great among the Gentiles: and in every place there is sacrifice, and there is offered to my name a clean oblation" (*Mal.*, 1, 11).
- The Sacrifice of the Mass is therefore the greatest possible act of divine worship. It is the only form of sacrifice now acceptable to God. The power to offer Mass is the greatest power of the Catholic priest. However, the members of the laity should remember that they too have a **share in the offering** of this divine sacrifice. It is in their name that the priest officiates; they offer the body and blood of Our Saviour to His eternal Father through the hands of the priest. And the more fervently they participate in the offering of the Mass, the more benefits they will receive from this precious sacrifice by which the death of our Redeemer on Calvary is daily represented and its benefits applied on thousands of altars throughout the Catholic Church.
- The more **actively and intimately** a person participates in the offering of the Mass, the greater benefits will he derive. Thus, a boy who serves Mass or a person who sings in the choir will partake more abundantly of the fruits of the Holy Sacrifice, other things being equal, than one who merely assists as a member of the congregation.

## Lesson 28: Holy Communion `(Rước Lễ Thiêng liêng)`

### Q. 366. What is Holy Communion?

**A.** Holy Communion is the receiving of **Jesus Christ** in the sacrament of the Holy Eucharist.

- Just as it is necessary to nourish our bodies with material food, so also it is necessary to nourish our souls with spiritual food. Our Divine Saviour so loved us that He gave us Himself in the sacrament of the Holy Eucharist; He gave us His own body and blood as food for our souls.
- It is not necessary that we receive Our Lord's body and blood under the appearances of both bread and wine. Christ is **entirely present** under the appearances of bread, and also entirely present under the appearances of wine. Therefore, we receive Him whole and entire under the appearances of bread alone or of wine alone.
- In some Eastern Churches the faithful receive Holy Communion under the appearances of both bread and wine. In the Western Church the faithful receive Communion only under the appearances of bread.

> `"Jesus therefore said to them, 'Amen, amen, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, you shall not have life in you. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has life everlasting and I will raise him up on the last day. For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink: indeed. He who eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, abides in me: and I in him. As the living Father has sent me, and as I live because of the Father, so he who eats me, he also shall live because of me. This is the bread that has come down from heaven; not as your fathers ate the manna, and died. He who eats this bread shall live forever (John 6:54-59).`

> `"And they continued steadfastly in the teaching of the apostles and in the communion of the breaking of the bread and in the prayers" (Acts 2:42).`

> *`See question 344, Scripture: Luke 22:19-20.`*

### Q. 367. What is necessary to receive Holy Communion worthily?

**A.** To receive Holy Communion worthily it is necessary to be **free from mortal sin**, to have a **right intention** and to obey the **Church's laws on the fast** required before Holy Communion out of reverence for the body and blood of Our Divine Lord. However, these are some cases in which Holy Communion may be received without fasting.

- **Venial sin** does not make us unworthy of receiving Holy Communion; but it does prevent us from receiving the more abundant graces and blessings which we would otherwise receive from Holy Communion.

> `"For I myself have received from the Lord (what I also delivered to you), that the Lord Jesus, on the night in which he was betrayed, took bread, and giving thanks broke, and said, 'This is my body which shall be given up for you; do this in remembrance of me.' In like manner also the cup, after he had supped, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as you shall eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the death of the Lord, until he comes.'"`

> `"Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily, will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of that bread and drink of the cup; for he who eats and drinks unworthily, without distinguishing the body, eats and drinks judgment to himself. This is why many among you are infirm and weak, and many sleep. But if we judged ourselves, we should not thus be judged. But when we are judged, we are being chastised by the Lord that we may not be condemned with this world. Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another. If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest you come together unto judgment. The rest I shall set in order when I come" (1 Corinthians 11:23-34).`

### Q. 368. Does he who knowingly receives Holy Communion in mortal sin receive the body and blood of Christ and His graces?

**A.** He who knowingly receives Holy Communion in mortal sin receives the body and blood of Christ, but he **does not receive His graces** and commits a grave sin of **sacrilege**.

- To receive Holy Communion unworthily is a serious abuse of the sacred body and blood of the Lord, and therefore a sacrilege.

> *`See Scripture, question 367, 1 Corinthians 11:23-34.`*

### Q. 369. What should we do to receive more abundantly the graces of Holy Communion?

**A.** To receive more abundantly the graces of Holy Communion we should strive to be most **fervent** and to free ourselves from **deliberate venial sin**.

### Q. 370. Does the Church now command us to fast from midnight before Holy Communion?

**A.** The Church does not now command us to fast from midnight before Holy Communion, as it did formerly. The laws enacted by **Pope Pius XII** now regulate this matter by the number of hours we must fast.

- For many centuries the Church commanded a strict fast from midnight before one could receive Holy Communion. However, in 1953 Pope Pius XII introduced a much more lenient form of fasting before Holy Communion, and in 1957 the same Pope granted greater concessions, in order to give Catholics an opportunity to receive Holy Communion more frequently.
- Pope Pius XII also allowed the celebration of afternoon and evening Masses every day, when the spiritual good of a considerable number of the faithful requires it. It is the right of the bishop of each diocese to decide when such Masses may be offered in his diocese.

### Q. 371. When may Holy Communion be received without fasting?

**A.** Holy Communion may be received without fasting when one is in **danger of death**, or when it is necessary to **save the Blessed Sacrament from insult or injury**.

- Ordinarily the danger of death comes from sickness or injury. But it is not necessary that a person be in danger of death from sickness in order to receive Holy Communion without fasting. The danger of death may come from some other cause. A soldier, for example, who is about, to go into battle or a person about to be executed may receive Holy Communion without fasting.

### Q. 372. What are the laws enacted by Pope Pius XII regarding the fast required before Holy Communion?

**A.** The laws enacted by Pope Pius XII regarding the fast required before Holy Communion are the following:

- **Water** may be taken at any time before Holy Communion without breaking the fast. Sick persons, though not confined to bed, may receive Holy Communion after taking **medicine or non-alcoholic drinks**. A priest's permission is not necessary.
- All Catholics may receive Holy Communion after fasting **three hours** from **food and alcoholic drinks** and **one hour** from **non-alcoholic drinks**. This applies to Holy Communion at midnight Mass as well as at Masses celebrated in the morning, afternoon or evening. A priest's permission is not necessary.
- Catholics are urged to observe the Eucharistic fast from midnight as formerly, and also to compensate for the use of the new privileges by works of charity and penance, but these practices are not obligatory. One who has already received Holy Communion may not receive the Blessed Sacrament again on the same day, except in danger of death.

### Q. 373. How should we prepare ourselves for Holy Communion?

**A.** We should prepare ourselves for Holy Communion by **thinking of Our Divine Redeemer** whom we are about to receive, and by making fervent **acts of faith, hope, love, and contrition**.

- We should be neat, clean, and modest in our appearance, and respectful and reverent in our manner. Each time we receive Holy Communion we should try to be as devout and fervent as if it were the only Communion of our lives. When actually receiving Communion we should raise the head and extend the tongue. We should swallow the sacred host as soon as possible, not allowing it to dissolve in the mouth.

> `"Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof; but only say the word, and my servant will be healed" (Matthew 8:8).`

> `"Behold, the lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world" (John 1:29).`

> *`See Scripture, question 366, John 6:54-59.`*

### Q. 374. What should we do after Holy Communion?

**A.** After Holy Communion we should spend some time **adoring Our Lord, thanking Him, renewing our promises of love and of obedience to Him**, and **asking Him for blessings** for ourselves and others.

> `"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you. For everyone who asks, receives; and he who seeks, finds; and to him who knocks, it shall be opened. Or what man is there among you, who, if his son asks him for a loaf, will hand him a stone; or if he asks for a fish, will hand him a serpent? Therefore, if you, evil as you are, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him!" (Matthew 7:7-11).`

### Q. 375. What are the chief effects of a worthy Holy Communion?

**A.** The chief effects of a worthy Holy Communion are:

1.  first, a **closer union with Our Lord** and a more fervent love of God and of our neighbor;
2.  second, an **increase of sanctifying grace**;
3.  third, **preservation from mortal sin** and the **remission of venial sin**;
4.  fourth, the **lessening of our inclinations to sin** and the help to practice good works.

> *`*See Scripture, question 366, John 6:54-59.`*

### Q. 376. When are we obliged to receive Holy Communion?

**A.** We are obliged to receive Holy Communion during **Easter time** each year and when in **danger of death**.

### Q. 377. Why is it well to receive Holy Communion often, even daily?

**A.** It is well to receive Holy Communion often, even daily, because this intimate union with **Jesus Christ, the Source of all holiness and the Giver of all graces, is the greatest aid to a holy life**.

> `"And they continued steadfastly in the teaching of the apostles and in the communion of the breaking of the bread and in the prayers" (Acts 2:42).`

> *`See Scripture, question 344, Luke 22:19-20; question 366, John 6:54-59.`*

### Q. 378. How should we show our gratitude to Our Lord for remaining always on our altars in the Holy Eucharist?

**A.** We should show our gratitude to Our Lord for remaining always on our altars in the Holy Eucharist, by **visiting Him often**, by **reverence in church**, by **assisting every day at Mass** when this is possible, by **attending parish devotions**, and by being present at **Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament**.

- **Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament** is a ceremony in which the sacred host is exposed for a time on the altar, usually in the monstrance. During Benediction the priest blesses the people with the sacred host.
- The **monstrance**, or ostensorium, is a large vessel in which the host is exposed to view through a glass-covered opening in the center.
- The long cloak-like vestment worn by the priest at Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament is called a **cope**. The **humeral veil** is placed over the priest's shoulders before he gives the blessing.

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT HOLY COMMUNION

- Just as the body needs food for the support of man's natural life, so the soul must be nourished for the preservation and the strengthening of its supernatural life. For this purpose Our Lord has given us a most precious food, **His own body and blood**. It is indeed a token of His Immeasurable love for souls that He wills to come personally into our hearts: In order to help and to console us in the difficulties and temptations of our journey through life. And He makes the conditions of receiving Him in Holy Communion very simple. Nothing more is necessary than that we have the proper intention and that we be in the state of **sanctifying grace**; **venial sins do not make us unworthy**. The Church, out of reverence for this great sacrament, demands that we observe the law of fasting, described above, before Holy Communion, but in certain circumstances, particularly in **danger of death**, this law does not bind. Even though one is not sick, if there is danger of death-as in the case of a soldier going into battle-he may receive Holy Communion without fasting at any hour of the day or night.
- Ordinarily it is permitted to receive Holy Communion only **once a day**, but there are exceptions to this rule. Thus, a person who has received Holy Communion in the morning may receive the Blessed Sacrament again as **Viaticum** if he falls into the danger of death in the course of the day. Again, a person who has already received Holy Communion could on the same day consume the Blessed Sacrament in order to protect It from insult or injury. Finally, a priest may receive Holy Communion more than once on the same day-namely, when he celebrates two or more Masses.
- If we were permitted to receive Holy Communion, only once in our lifetime we should surely prepare carefully for this great event. But we are allowed to receive this sacrament **every day**, except Holy Saturday, when the Easter Vigil Mass is celebrated after midnight. The frequency with which we can approach the holy table should not diminish our fervor. Each time we receive Our Lord we should prepare our souls for His coming, considering that we are to have a privilege even greater than that of Martha and Mary and the other friends of Christ who welcomed Him into their homes when He dwelt on earth.
- Even when we cannot actually receive Holy Communion we can make an act of **spiritual communion**, which is an act of faith and love toward Our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament, with an ardent desire to receive Him.
- Until comparatively recent times, daily Communion was very rare in the Church. However, children were generally not admitted to their First Communion until they were about ten years old. But a great and holy Pope, **Pius X**, who ruled the Church from 1903 to 1914, urgently invited all Catholics to partake of the Divine Banquet frequently, even daily, telling them that the only necessary conditions are the state of grace and a right intention. He also laid down the law that children are to be admitted to Holy Communion as soon as they reach the **age of reason**, when they are about seven years old. Certainly Our Lord must be pleased that through the efforts of this great Pope He has the opportunity of coming so frequently into the hearts of His faithful, especially into the innocent hearts of little children.
- Sometimes we hear a person say that he intends to receive Holy Communion for someone else, and we should understand correctly what is meant by this. We cannot receive Holy Communion for another in the sense that we can transfer to him the graces conferred by the sacrament, for these belong to the **recipient alone**. But we can receive Holy Communion for another in the sense that we can **pray for him** at the time of Holy Communion, when our prayers have great value, and if we receive Holy Communion for a deceased person, we can offer for him any **indulgences** we may gain on that occasion.
- No matter what difficulties we may encounter, no matter how many temptations we may have to overcome, no matter what sorrows may enter into our life, Our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament will give us the grace and the strength that we need. And we are permitted not only to receive Him in Holy Communion but also to visit Him in the **tabernacle**, where He remains day and night, saying to us as He said long ago to those who were in pain and sorrow: "Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest" (*Matthew* 11:28).

## Lesson 29: Penance `(Bí tích Giải tội/Hòa Giải/Sám Hối)`

### Q. 379. What is the sacrament of Penance?

**A.** Penance is the sacrament by which sins committed after Baptism are forgiven through the absolution of the priest.

- Penance is a supernatural moral virtue that prompts the sinner to detest his sins and incites him to offer satisfaction for them and to amend his life in the future.
- Penance is also a sacrament instituted by Our Divine Saviour in which sins committed after Baptism are forgiven through the absolution of the priest.
- Through mortal sin, the soul is deprived of its supernatural life. The sacrament of Penance raises the soul from death to supernatural life.

### Q. 380. Whence has the priest the power to forgive sins?

**A.** The priest has the power to forgive sins from Jesus Christ, who said to His apostles and to their successors in the priesthood: "Receive the Holy Spirit; whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained."

- Our Lord spoke these words to the apostles when He appeared to them after His Resurrection. During His life on earth, Christ forgave sinners in His own name and by His own authority. Before ascending to His Father in heaven, He wanted to confer that power on His apostles and their successors in the priesthood. He knew that many persons would commit grievous sins after they had received sanctifying grace in the sacrament of Baptism.
- No man, by his own power and authority, could possibly forgive sins. Only God can do that because sin is an offense against Him. But the priest, as God's representative, can forgive sins because God has given him the power to do so.

> `"But if thy brother sin against thee, go and show him his fault, between thee and him alone. If he listen to thee, thou hast won thy brother. But if he do not listen to thee, take with thee one or two more so that on the word of two or three witnesses every word may be confirmed. And if he refuse to hear them, appeal to the Church, but if he refuse to hear even the Church, let him be to thee as the heathen and the publican. Amen I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound also in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed also in heaven" (Matthew 18:15-18).`

### Q. 381. With what words does the priest forgive sins?

**A.** The priest forgives sins with the words: "I absolve thee from thy sins in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen."

- The power to forgive sins by pronouncing these words of absolution is given to the priest at his ordination. In order to exercise this power the priest must have jurisdiction, or be authorized to act as a spiritual judge over the persons he absolves. This jurisdiction ordinarily is given to the priest by the bishop of the diocese where the sacrament is administered.
- The jurisdiction to absolve from certain serious sins and excommunications is reserved to the bishop or the Pope. Except in case of danger of death, or great urgency, a priest must have special authority to absolve these sins and excommunications.

#### Penance

- *The large picture in the center shows Our Lord appearing to the Apostles in the Cenacle on the day of His Resurrection.*

> `"Receive the Holy Spirit; whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained." (St. John 20:22-23).`

- *By these words, Our Lord instituted the sacrament of Penance, giving to the Apostles and to all priests the power to remit sins.*
    
- *Jesus Christ forgave sins several times during His life. At the top right, a paralytic has been brought to Him to be cured. Our Lord says to him,*
    

> `"Take courage, son; thy sins are forgiven thee.' Then, some of the scribes who were present said within themselves, 'This man blasphemes.' And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, 'Why do you harbor evil thoughts in your hearts? For which is easier, to say, "Thy sins are forgiven thee," or to say, "Arise, and walk?" But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins'-then he said to the paralytic 'Arise, take up thy pallet and go to thy house.' and he arose, and went away to his house' " (St. Matthew 9:2-7).`

- *At the bottom right is a penitent who has gone to confession and received the pardon of his sins. On one side is his guardian angel giving him hope for heaven, and on the other side is the demon who was driven from his soul by the absolution. At bottom left is a man who has made a sacrilegious confession. He has cooperated with the demon by willfully holding back a mortal sin in confession, and, instead of obtaining pardon, he has committed another serious sin. His good angel turns away in sorrow while he is led away by the demon.*
    
- *At the top left is a model of perfect contrition in the person of St. Mary Magdalene. This woman, having led an evil life, came one day to lament her sins at the feet of Jesus Christ in the hope of obtaining pardon. Our Lord, who was at table with a Pharisee named Simon, declared that many sins were forgiven Magdalene, because she had loved much. Then He said to her,*
    

> `"Thy sins are forgiven thee; go in peace." (St.).`

### Q. 382. What are effects of the sacrament of Penance, worthily received?

**A.** The effects of the sacrament of Penance, worthily received are: first, the restoration or increase of sanctifying grace; second, the forgiveness of sins; third, the remission of the eternal punishment, if necessary, and also of part, at least, of the temporal punishment, due to our sins; fourth, the help to avoid sin in future; fifth, the restoration of the merits of our good works if they have been lost by mortal sin.

- When we receive the sacrament of Penance worthily, the merits of Christ's redemption are applied to us. Sanctifying grace is either restored or, if we are already in the state of grace, increased. The worthy reception of the sacrament of Penance also gives us a right to receive those actual graces which we will need in atoning for our past sins and avoiding sins in the future.

### Q. 383. What else does the sacrament of Penance do for us?

**A.** The sacrament of Penance also gives us the opportunity to receive spiritual advice and instruction from our confessor.

- It is advisable to have a regular confessor, although one is free to confess to any authorized priest.

### Q. 384. What must we do to receive the sacrament of Penance worthily?

**A.** To receive the sacrament of Penance worthily, we must: first, examine our conscience; second, be sorry for our sins; third, have the firm purpose of not sinning again; fourth, confess our sins to the priest; fifth, be willing to perform the penance the priest gives us.

> `"But if the wicked do penance for all his sins which he hath committed and keep all my commandments and do judgment and justice, living he shall live, and shall not die. I will not remember all his iniquities that he hath done: in his justice which he hath wrought, he shall live. Is it my will that a sinner should die, saith the Lord God, and not that he should be converted from his ways and live?" (Ezechiel 18:21-23).`

### Q. 385. What is an examination of conscience?

**A.** An examination of conscience is a sincere effort to call to mind all the sins we have committed since our last worthy confession.

### Q. 386. What should we do before our examination of conscience?

**A.** Before our examination of conscience, we should ask God's help to know our sins and to confess them with sincere sorrow.

### Q. 387. How can we make a good examination of conscience?

**A.** We can make a good examination of conscience by calling to mind the commandments of God and of the Church, and the particular duties of our state of life, and by asking ourselves how we may have sinned with regard to them.

- We should give sufficient time to an examination of conscience, making it carefully and thoughtfully, and attempting to remember all our sins.

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT PENANCE

- When a person becomes sick he tries to recover his health by taking medicine. Our Blessed Lord knew that human beings are inclined to sin and thus bring on themselves sickness of soul. Indeed, mortal sin brings on spiritual death, for it deprives the soul of its supernatural life, sanctifying grace. For those who sin before being baptized, Our Saviour intended Baptism as the means of forgiveness and for the birth of the soul to the life of grace. But he knew that even after Baptism many would sin, some even grievously; and in His mercy He determined to provide these with a remedy-a sacrament that would be more potent in the spiritual order than the most effective medicine is in the physical order. For no medicine can restore a dead person to life; but the sacrament which Our Lord determined to give us is able to restore the life of grace to any soul, no matter how grievously it may be laden with sin. The sacrament is Penance. Our Lord gave some indication of His purpose to provide such a sacrament when He said to the apostles: "Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound also in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed also in heaven" ( 18). In these words, is implied the power to loose men from the bonds of sin. But a clearer declaration of this sacrament is found in Our Lord's words to the apostles on Easter Sunday after His resurrection: "Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained" ( 23). This power of forgiving sins, being given by Our Lord for the benefit of all mankind, has been passed down to the successors of the apostles, the bishops and the priests of the Catholic Church.
- Our Saviour could indeed have decreed that men should receive the pardon of their sins by going directly to God with contrition. But a sacrament, administered by men in the name of God, is a more assuring and a more effective means. The conditions for the reception of this sacrament are very easy. The penitent confesses his sins with true contrition and the priest by the authority of God forgives him. In the early days of Christianity, the Church administered this sacrament with far greater severity than nowadays. The worst sinners were sometimes obliged to perform penance publicly for a long time before receiving the pardon of their sins. But today the Church is most lenient; she receives the sinner kindly and makes his return to God as easy as possible. Every day throughout the world thousands of sinners are making use of the sacrament of Penance to have the sins of many years washed from their souls and to be restored to the life of grace and the friendship of God.
- Sometimes a person is refused absolution in the confessional because the priest judges that he is not sufficiently disposed for the reception of the sacrament of Penance. This is particularly the case when the priest believes that the penitent is not truly sorry for his sins or has not a firm resolution to avoid sin and the near occasions of sin in future. A person who has been refused absolution should humbly accept the priest's decision and endeavor to dispose himself properly so that he may receive absolution when he returns to confession at the time determined by the confessor.
- We can never sufficiently thank Our Blessed Saviour for the sacrament of Penance. We read in the Gospel of various occasions on which He Himself forgave sinners, such as the case of Mary Magdalene and of the penitent thief who hung beside Him on Calvary. We feel that these persons were fortunate because they received from the lips of Christ Himself the consoling assurance that their sins were forgiven. Yet, we too have a like assurance, for Our Lord Himself really administers the sacrament of Penance through the ministry of His priest; He himself says to us, when we have made a worthy confession: "Go in peace, thy sins are forgiven thee."

## Lesson 30: Contrition `(Ăn năn tội)`

### Q. 388. What is contrition?

**A.** Contrition is sincere sorrow for having offended God, and hatred for the sins we have committed, with a firm purpose of sinning no more.

- It is unreasonable to expect a person to pardon us for any offense unless we are sincerely sorry for the act that has given offense and are firmly determined not to repeat the act in the future.
- By sin we offend and insult God. Unless we are sincerely sorry for our sins and are firmly resolved not to commit them again, we cannot reasonably expect God to forgive us.

> `"Let the wicked forsake his way and the unjust man his thoughts, and let him return to the Lord; and he will have mercy on him: and to our God; for he is bountiful to forgive" (Isaias 55:7).`

> `"And when the wicked turneth himself away from his wickedness, which he hath wrought, and doeth judgment and justice, he shall save his soul alive. Because he considereth and turneth away himself from all his iniquities which he hath wrought, he shall surely live and not die" (Ezechiel 18:27-28).`

> `"But when he came to himself, he said, 'How many hired men in my father's house have bread in abundance, while I am perishing here with hunger! I will get up and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee. I am no longer worthy to be called thy son; make me as one of thy hired men.' And he arose and went to his father. And they began to make merry" (Luke 15:17-24).`

> `"But while he was yet a long way off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion, and ran and fell upon the neck and kissed him. And the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee. I am no longer worthy to be called thy son.' But the father said to his servants, 'Fetch quickly the best robe and put it on him, and give him a ring for his finger and sandals for your feet; and bring out the fattened calf and kill it, and let us eat and make merry; because this my son was dead, and has come to life again; he was lost, and is found.' And they began to make merry" (Luke 15:17-24).`

### Q. 389. Will God forgive us any sin that we don't have true contrition for?

**A.** God will not forgive us any sin, whether mortal or venial, unless we have true contrition for it.

- Sometimes people are unwilling to pardon our offenses against them even when we are sincerely sorry for having offended them. But God will always forgive us our sins when we are sincerely sorry for them. He will not forgive us, however, unless we are sincerely sorry.

> `"Now therefore saith the Lord: Be converted to me with all your heart, in fasting and in weeping and in mourning. And rend your hearts and not your garments, and turn to the Lord your God: for he is gracious and merciful, patient and rich in mercy, and ready to repent of the evil. Who knoweth but he will return and forgive and leave a blessing behind him, sacrifice and libation to the Lord your God?" (Joel 2:12-14).`

### Q. 390. When is sorrow for sin true contrition?

**A.** Sorrow for sin is true contrition when it is interior, supernatural, supreme, and universal.

> David's sorrow for sin as expressed in is true contrition:

> It is interior: `"My sacrifice, O God, is a contrite spirit; a contrite and humbled heart, O God, thou wilt not despise" (v. 19).`

> It is supernatural: `"Create a pure heart for me, O God, and renew in me a steadfast spirit" (v. 12).`

> It is supreme: The entire conveys David's hatred of sin and his willingness to endure anything rather than sin again.

> It is universal: `"Turn thy face away from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities" (v. 11).`

### Q. 391. When is our sorrow interior?

**A.** Our sorrow is interior when it comes from our heart, and not merely from our lips.

- It is not enough merely to say that we are sorry for our sins. We must really mean it. We must sincerely detest our sins and firmly intend not to commit them again. We do not, however, have to feel our sorrow, for contrition is an act of the will, not of the feelings.

### Q. 392. When is our sorrow supernatural?

**A.** Our sorrow is supernatural when, with the help of God's grace, it arises from motives that spring from faith and not merely from natural motives.

- "Motives that spring from faith" are truths God has revealed; God has revealed, for example, that mortal sin will be punished in hell, venial sin in purgatory; that sin caused Christ to die; that sin is an offense against the infinite goodness of God; and that sin is hateful in itself. If we are sorry for our sins for one of these reasons, then, with God's grace, our sorrow is supernatural; it is prompted by truths which we believe because of the authority of God who revealed them.
- If we are sorry for our sins because they injure our health or will be punished by the civil courts or cause us to lose our friends, then our sorrow is natural. It is prompted by natural reasons. It is not wrong to be sorry for our sins because of natural motives; but this natural sorrow is not sufficient to obtain God's pardon.

### Q. 393. When is our sorrow supreme?

**A.** Our sorrow is supreme when we hate sin above every other evil, and are willing to endure anything rather than offend God in the future by sin.

- We know that sin is the greatest of all evils because it is an offense against God, the greatest Good, and for that reason we should detest it more than we detest any other evil.

### Q. 394. When is our sorrow universal?

**A.** Our sorrow is universal when we are sorry for every mortal sin that we may have had the misfortune to commit.

- When mortal sins are forgiven sanctifying grace enters the soul and it is impossible for sanctifying grace to enter the soul if a single mortal sin remains there. All our mortal sins, therefore, must be forgiven, or none of them is forgiven.

### Q. 395. Should we always try to have sorrow for all our venial sins when receiving the sacrament of Penance?

**A.** We should try to have sorrow for all our venial sins when receiving the sacrament of Penance, and, when we have only venial sins to confess, we must have sorrow for at least one of them or for some sin of our past life which we confess.

### Q. 396. Why should we have contrition for mortal sin?

**A.** We should have contrition for mortal sin because it is the greatest of all evils, gravely offends God, keeps us out of heaven, and condemns us forever to hell.

> `"Turn to the Lord: and forsake thy sins ... Return to the Lord, and turn away from thy injustice: and greatly hate abomination" (Ecclesiasticus 17:21, 23).`

> `"If anyone does not abide in me, he shall be cast outside as the branch and wither; and they shall gather them up and cast them into the fire, and they shall burn" (John 15:6).`

> `"Or do you not know that the unjust will not possess the kingdom of God?" (1 Corinthians 6:9).`

> `"But when sin has matured, it begets death" (James 1:15).`

### Q. 397. Why should we have contrition for venial sin?

**A.** We should have contrition for venial sin because it is displeasing to God, merits temporal punishment, and may lead to mortal sin.

- As long as a person has mortal sin on his soul he cannot be pardoned for his venial sins. Mortal sin makes man an enemy of God. He cannot, therefore, receive pardon for his slighter offenses if he does not receive pardon for the serious offenses that make him an enemy of God.
- A person having only venial sins on his soul can obtain pardon for those for which he is sincerely sorry, even though other venial sins remain unforgiven because he is not sorry for them.

### Q. 398. How many kinds of contrition are there?

**A.** There are two kinds of contrition: perfect contrition and imperfect contrition.

### Q. 399. When is our contrition perfect?

**A.** Our contrition is perfect when we are sorry for our sins because sin offends God, whom we love above all things for His own sake.

- We love God because He is the supreme Good. Sin is the greatest evil because it is an offense against God, the supreme Good. Our sorrow for sin is perfect, therefore, when we detest sin because it offends God, whom we love above all things.

> *`See Scripture, question 390, .`*

### Q. 400. When is our contrition imperfect?

**A.** Our contrition is imperfect when we are sorry for our sins because they are hateful in themselves or because we fear God's punishment.

- Imperfect contrition is sometimes called attrition.

> `"And the children of Israel said to the Lord: We have sinned: do thou unto us whatsoever pleaseth thee. Only deliver us this time" (Judges 10:15).`

### Q. 401. To receive the sacrament of Penance worthily, what kind of contrition is sufficient?

**A.** To receive the sacrament of Penance worthily, imperfect contrition is sufficient.

### Q. 402. Should we always try to have perfect contrition in the sacrament of Penance?

**A.** We should always try to have perfect contrition in the sacrament of Penance because perfect contrition is more pleasing to God, and because with His help we can always have it.

### Q. 403. How can a person in mortal sin regain the state of grace before receiving the sacrament of Penance?

**A.** A person in mortal sin can regain the state of grace before receiving the sacrament of Penance by making an act of perfect contrition with the sincere purpose of going to confession.

- It is not true that we can regain the state of grace by perfect contrition only when we are in danger of death or when it is impossible to go to confession. In order to regain sanctifying grace by perfect contrition, it is sufficient that we intend to go to confession the next time we are obliged to do so.

> `"Is it my will that a sinner should die, saith the Lord God, and not that he should be converted from his ways and live?" (Ezechiel 18:23).`

### Q. 404. What should we do if we have the misfortune to commit a mortal sin?

**A.** If we have the misfortune to commit a mortal sin, we should ask God's pardon and grace at once, make an act of perfect contrition, and go to confession as soon as we can.

### Q. 405. May we receive Holy Communion after committing a mortal sin, if we merely make an act of perfect contrition?

**A.** We may not receive Holy Communion after committing a mortal sin, if we merely make an act of perfect contrition; one who has sinned grievously must go to confession before receiving Holy Communion.

### Q. 406. What is the firm purpose of sinning no more?

**A.** The firm purpose of sinning no more is the sincere resolve not only to avoid sin but to avoid as far as possible the near occasions of sin.

- This firm purpose of amendment does not necessarily exclude the fear that a person may repeat his sin in the future. It does mean that, at the time, a person, relying fully upon God's grace, sincerely intends never to commit this sin again.
- The firm purpose of amendment includes also the intention to remain away from persons, places, or things that may easily lead him to sin.
- The firm purpose of amendment must include not only those mortal sins which the person has committed in the past and confessed, but also all mortal sins.

> `"He that loveth danger shall perish in it" (Ecclesiasticus 3:27).`

> `"My son, hast thou sinned? Do so no more: but for thy former sins also pray that they may be forgiven thee. Flee from sins as from the face of a serpent: for if thou comest near them, they will take hold of thee" (Ecclesiasticus 21:1-2).`

> `"Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation" (Mark 14:38).`

> `"Then Jesus said, 'Neither will I condemn thee. Go thy way, and from now on sin no more' "(John 8:11).`

> `"Do not be led astray, 'evil companionships corrupt good morals' " (1 Corinthians 15:33).`

### Q. 407. What purpose of amendment must a person have if he has only venial sins to confess?

**A.** If a person has only venial sins to confess, he must have the purpose of avoiding at least one of them.

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT CONTRITION

- If we insult a friend, it is our duty to ask his pardon, to tell him we are sorry, to promise that we shall not repeat the offense. We must do the same toward God when we offend Him by sin. We cannot expect Him to forgive us unless we turn to Him with true sorrow of soul, or contrition. On the other hand, if we turn to Him with the necessary contrition, He will forgive us. In this, His mercy is greater than that of creatures. Sometimes we ask a human being to pardon the wrong we have done, but he refuses. But God is always ready to forgive the sinner, however wicked he has been, if he returns to his heavenly Father with true sorrow of heart. Naturally, this sorrow must be based on motives of faith, not on merely natural motives. It must extend to all mortal sins, it must include a firm purpose of not sinning, at least mortally, in future; it must contain the will to endure any suffering rather than offend God by grievous sin in the time to come. Such an act of contrition is not difficult for anyone who knows from the principles of the Catholic faith how terrible an evil is sin. One must remember also that God is always ready to give the grace to make an act of contrition to anyone who sincerely begs His assistance.
- When we say that God will not forgive any sin without contrition, we are speaking only of actual sin, not of original sin. We cannot have contrition for original sin since we did not contract it by our own free will; hence, infants who have only original sin are cleansed of that sin by Baptism, without making any act of contrition.
- In the sacrament of Penance, contrition based on any supernatural motive suffices, even though it arises merely from the fear of God's punishments, of which He has spoken to us frequently in revelation. It is true, contrition based on fear alone is not very noble. Indeed, it might be called selfish. Yet, Our Lord proposed this as a good motive of contrition when He said: "Be afraid of him who, after He was killed, has power to cast into hell" ( 5). Other reasons for contrition, sufficient to obtain the forgiveness of sins in the sacrament of Penance, are the realization of the ingratitude to God that every sin contains, the hatefulness of sin as opposed to the supernatural virtues, the injustice to our Creator included in every transgression of His law.
- The noblest type of contrition is that which arises from the love of God for His own sake, or because of His own goodness. This is called perfect contrition, and it has the power to procure the forgiveness of all mortal sins that may be on the soul of the person who detests his sins from this motive. It was of this contrition that Our Lord spoke when He said, pointing to the repentant sinner, Mary Magdalene, "Her sins, many as they are, shall be forgiven her, because she has loved much" ( 47). It is indeed unfortunate that Catholics are often unaware of the wonderful power of perfect contrition. Some think it remits sin only when one is in danger of death and cannot get to confession. The truth is that an act of perfect contrition will always take away mortal sin; one has only to have the intention of going to confession when he is next obliged to do so-that is, within the year or when in danger of death-and telling the mortal sins which have been remitted by perfect contrition. One who has had his sins forgiven by perfect contrition may not go to Communion until he has been to confession; nevertheless he can enjoy the advantages of being in the state of grace and of gaining merit for his good works.
- A person can have at the same time both perfect and imperfect contrition for his sins. One does not exclude the other. For this reason we say in our act of contrition: "I detest all my sins because of thy just punishments" thus expressing imperfect contrition, and then we add our expression of perfect contrition, when we say: "But most of all because they offend Thee, my God, who art all-good and deserving of all my love."

### RESOLUTION

- Resolve that if ever you are so unfortunate as to fall into mortal sin, you will immediately make an act of perfect contrition and thus regain the state of sanctifying grace.

She makes a very truthful confession of her wickedness, but is very disappointed when the priest insists that she stay away from the place altogether.

- Merlin, staying at a camp for the summer, committed a mortal sin; but that same evening made an act of perfect contrition. The following Sunday he attended Mass, celebrated by a visiting priest in the dining hall of the camp. The priest explained to the congregation that he could not hear confessions because he came from another diocese and did not have jurisdiction for administering the sacrament of Penance in the diocese where the camp was situated. "However," he added, "those who have committed no mortal sin since their last confession may receive Holy Communion, if they wish." Merlin concluded that, even though he had committed a mortal sin since his last confession, he was now in the state of grace through his act of perfect contrition; hence, he received Holy Communion. Did he reason correctly?
