## Lesson 8: The Redemption `(Sự Cứu chuộc)`

> "I BELIEVE ... IN JESUS CHRIST ... WHO ... SUFFERED UNDER PONTIUS PILATE, WAS CRUCIFIED, DIED, AND WAS BURIED. HE DESCENDED INTO HELL; THE THIRD DAY HE AROSE AGAIN FROM THE DEAD; HE ASCENDED INTO HEAVEN, SITTETH AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD, THE FATHER ALMIGHTY; FROM THENCE HE SHALL COME TO JUDGE THE LIVING AND THE DEAD ... "

### Q. 90. What is meant by the Redemption?

**A.** By the Redemption is meant that Jesus Christ, as the Redeemer of the whole human race, offered His sufferings and death to God as a fitting sacrifice in satisfaction for the sins of men, and regained for them the right to be children of God and heirs of heaven.10

- Satisfaction is compensation for an offense or injury against another. A redeemer is one who pays a price to regain something that has been lost or given up.
    
- No creature could, of himself, make adequate satisfaction for sin, which offends the infinite majesty of God. Every creature is finite and, as such, is unable to make infinite satisfaction. Although God wished all to be saved, and although Christ died for all, yet only those to whom the merits of His Passion are applied will benefit by His death. The death of Christ was a sacrifice of infinite merit and satisfaction, by which man was redeemed. Christ was both priest and victim in the sacrifice whereby He redeemed us. As priest He offered His Passion and death to God for us, and as victim He suffered and died.
    

> `"Walk in love, as Christ also loved us and delivered himself up for us an offering and a sacrifice to God to ascend in fragrant odor" (Ephesians 5:2).`

> `"He has rescued us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have our redemption, the remission of our sins" (Colossians 1:13-14).`

> `" ... looking for the blessed hope and glorious coming of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and cleanse for himself an acceptable people, pursuing good works" (Titus 2:13-14).`

### Q. 91. What were the chief sufferings of Christ?

**A.** The chief sufferings of Christ were His bitter agony of soul, His bloody sweat, His cruel scourging, and His crowning with thorns, His crucifixion, and His death on the cross.

- The Stations of the Cross and the Sorrowful Mysteries of the Rosary call to mind the chief sufferings of Christ. Christ suffered and died in His human nature; in His divine nature He could neither suffer nor die. All of His sufferings, even the least, were of infinite value because His human and divine natures were united in the divine Person of the Son of God.

### Q. 92. When did Christ die?

**A.** Christ died on Good Friday.

### Q. 93. Where did Christ die?

**A.** Christ died on Golgotha, a place outside the city of Jerusalem.

- The site of Christ's death is also called the Place of the Skull, and Mount Calvary.

> `"And they came to the place called Golgotha, that is, the Place of the Skull" (Matthew 27:33).`

### Q. 94. What do we learn from the sufferings and death of Christ?

**A.** From the sufferings and death of Christ we learn God's love for man and the evil of sin, for which God, who is all-just, demands such great satisfaction.

- We also learn that we should return God's great love and willingly take up our cross and follow Him.

### Q. 95. What do we mean when we say in the Apostles' Creed that Christ descended into hell?

**A.** When we say that Christ descended into hell, we mean that, after He died, the soul of Christ descended into a place or state of rest, called limbo, where the souls of the just were waiting for Him.

- Heaven had been closed by the sin of Adam. The just among the dead could not enter heaven until Christ satisfied for man's sin and repaired its injuries. They awaited their redemption in limbo.
    
- "Put to death indeed in the flesh, he was brought to life in the spirit, in which also he went and preached to those spirits that were in prison" (1 Peter 3:18-19).
    

> `"And Jesus said to him, 'Amen I say to thee, this day thou shalt be with me in paradise' " (Luke 23:43).`

### Q. 96. Why did Christ go to limbo?

**A.** Christ went to limbo to announce to the souls waiting there the joyful news that He had reopened heaven to mankind.

### Q. 97. Where was Christ's body while His soul was in limbo?

**A.** While His soul was in limbo, Christ's body was in the Holy Sepulchre.

- Man dies when soul is separated from body. When Jesus died, His soul and His body were separated from each other but His divine Person remained united both to His body in the tomb and to His separated soul in limbo.

> `"And Joseph taking the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid it in his new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock. Then he rolled a large stone to the entrance of the tomb, and departed" (Matthew 27:59-60).`

### Q. 98. When did Christ rise from the dead?

**A.** Christ rose from the dead, glorious and immortal, on Easter Sunday, the third day after His death.

- In the Resurrection the soul of Jesus was reunited to His body by His own divine power. The Resurrection is the most important of Christ's miracles. He Himself chose it as the most conclusive proof of His divine mission, and the apostles appealed to it to confirm the truth of their testimony.
    
- Christ's glorified body after its Resurrection was not subject to suffering or death; it possessed a certain radiance flowing from the supreme blessedness of His soul, it could move rapidly from place to place, it did not need food or sleep, and it could pass through other bodies.
    

> `"He said to them, 'Do not be terrified. You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen, he is not here. Behold the place where they laid him' " (Mark 16:6).`

> `"But he strictly charged them, and commanded them not to tell this to anyone, saying, 'The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and Scribes, and be put to death, and on the third day rise again' " (Luke 9:21-22).`

### Q. 99. Why did Christ rise from the dead?

**A.** Christ rose from the dead to show that He is true God and to teach us that we, too, shall rise from the dead.

> `"Now if Christ is preached as risen from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? But if there is no resurrection of the dead, both has Christ risen; and if Christ has not risen, vain then is our preaching, vain too is your faith. Yes, and we are found false witnesses as to God, in that we have borne witness against God that he raised Christ whom he did not raise, if the dead do not rise. For if the dead do not rise, neither has Christ risen; and if Christ has not risen, vain is your faith, for you are still in your sins" (1 Corinthians 15:12-17).`

### Q. 100. Will all men rise from the dead?

**A.** All men will rise from the dead, but only those who have been faithful to Christ will share in His glory.

> `"Do not wonder at this, for the hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs shall hear the voice of the Son of God. And they who have done good shall come forth unto resurrection of life; but they who have done evil unto resurrection of judgment" (John 5:28-29).`

> `"Now this is the will of him who sent me, the Father, that I should lose nothing of what He has given me, but that I should raise it up on the last day" (John 6:39).`

> `"Behold, I tell you a mystery: we shall all indeed rise, but we shall not all be changed-in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall rise incorruptible and we shall be changed. For this corruptible body must put on incorruption, and this mortal body must put on immortality" (1 Corinthians 15:51-53).`

***Our Lord's Descent into Limbo***

*This picture shows the soul of Jesus Christ appearing to the captive souls in limbo. In the foreground are Adam and Eve on their knees. Immediately to the left, Abraham is raising a knife above Isaac, Jacob with a staff in his hand, David with his lyre, etc. On the right is Moses with rays of light coming from his head, Aaron with his rod, St. Joseph holding a lily, etc.*

***Our Lord stayed with them until His Resurrection.***

*At the bottom of the plate is the hell of the damned, where the demons and the condemned are punished. Jesus Christ did not descend to this place of eternal suffering nor to purgatory, but He did have an effect on the damned by making them recognize His divinity and on the souls of purgatory by giving them the hope of glory.*

***The Resurrection of Our Lord***

*This picture shows the Resurrection of Our Lord Jesus Christ.*

> The holy women who are at left came, according to the Gospel, to embalm the body of Jesus, when suddenly there was a great earthquake. The angel of the Lord came from heaven, rolled back the stone, and sat upon it. The frightened soldiers fell to the ground as if dead. When the holy women entered the sepulcher, they were frightened by the sight of the angel. But he said to them, "Do not be terrified. You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen, He is not here. Behold the place where they laid Him." (St. Mark 16:6)

***The Ascension of Our Lord***

*This picture shows the Ascension of Jesus Christ from the Mount of Olives. This mountain has three peaks, and it is from the middle one that Our Lord ascended to Heaven in the presence of His disciples and the holy women. While He was going up, as it is said, He left the imprint of His feet on the rock.*

> At the moment when Jesus Christ disappeared from the sight of His disciples in a luminous cloud, two angels appeared to them and said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up to heaven? This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall come in the same way as you have seen Him going up to heaven."

### Q. 101. When did Christ ascend into heaven?

**A.** Christ ascended, body and soul, into heaven on Ascension Day, forty days after His Resurrection.

> `"Now he led them out towards Bethany, and he lifted up his hands and blessed them. And it came to pass as he blessed them, that he parted from them and was carried up into heaven" (Luke 24:50-51).`

### Q. 102. Why did Christ remain on earth forty days after His Resurrection?

**A.** Christ remained on earth forty days after His Resurrection to prove that He had truly risen from the dead and to complete the instruction of the apostles.

- Saint Paul tells us that Christ, after His Resurrection, appeared frequently to the apostles and to many others. Christ ascended into heaven from Mount Olivet, a hill outside Jerusalem.

> `"To them also he showed himself alive after his passion by many proofs, during forty days appearing to them and speaking of the kingdom of God" (Acts 1:3).`

> `"Christ ... rose again the third day, he appeared to Cephas, and after that to the Eleven. Then he was seen by more than five hundred brethren at one time ... After that he was seen by James, then by all the apostles. And last of all, he was seen also by me" (1 Corinthians 15:3-8).`

### Q. 103. What do we mean when we say that Christ sits at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty?

**A.** When we say that Christ sits at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty, we mean that Our Lord as God is equal to the Father, and that as man He shares above all the saints in the glory of His Father and exercises for all eternity the supreme authority of a king over all creatures.

- Even as man, Christ of Himself has dominion over all creation. His Kingship rests on the fact that His human nature is immediately united to the divine Person of the Son of God, and on the fact that He redeemed all men with His precious blood. On earth Christ exercises His kingly authority in spiritual matters through His Church. His Kingship extends also over temporal and civil matters.

> `"All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me" (Matthew 28:18).`

> `"For as the Father has life in himself, even so he has given to the Son also to have life in himself; and he has granted him power to render judgment, because he is Son of Man" (John 5:26-27).`

> `"Pilate therefore said to him, 'Thou art then a king?' Jesus answered, 'Thou sayest it; I am a king. This is why I was born, and why I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth' " (John 18:37).`

> `"Therefore, if you have risen with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God" (Colossians 3:1).`

> `"Jesus, who for the joy set before him, endured a cross, despising shame, and sits at the right hand of the throne of God" (Hebrews 12:2).`

> `"And from his mouth goes forth a sharp sword with which to smite the nations. And he will rule them with a rod of iron, and he treads the wine press of the fierce wrath of God almighty. And he has on his garment and on his thigh a name written, 'King of kings and Lord of lords' " (Apocalypse 19:15-16).`

### Q. 104. What do we mean when we say that Christ will come from thence to judge the living and the dead?

**A.** When we say that Christ will come from thence to judge the living and the dead, we mean that on the last day Our Lord will come to pronounce a sentence of eternal reward or of eternal punishment on everyone who has ever lived in tills world.

- Jesus Christ, both as God and as man, will judge all men because He is "King of kings and Lord of lords" (Apocalypse 17:14; 19:16), and it is His prerogative to pass judgment, to reward or punish according to merits.

> `"For the Son of Man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will render to everyone according to his conduct" (Matthew 16:27).`

> `"For neither does the Father Judge any man, but all judgment he has given to the Son" (John 5:22).`

> `"And he charged us to preach to the people and to testify that he it is who has been appointed by God to be judge of the living and of the dead" (Acts 10:42).`

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT THE REDEMPTION

- Jesus Christ saved the world from the evil effects of both original sin and the actual sins of men by a life and death of suffering. His death on the cross was a sacrifice to His Father-a sacrifice in which He was both priest and victim. He was not obliged to suffer as much as He did in order to redeem us, for even the least suffering on His part would have sufficed to redeem all mankind because of the infinite dignity of His divine personality, which gave infinite satisfactory value to even the least of His sufferings. But He suffered so intensely and died the painful death of the cross in order to prove His great love for us.
    
- Because His death means so much for the human race, the Catholic Church cherishes a great devotion to the representation of His death, the crucifix. The crucifix is the chief reminder of Jesus Christ. In every church and school, the crucifix occupies a prominent place; and it should be found also in every Catholic home. Nothing is better calculated to teach us the greatness of God's love for men, and the malice of sin. It is because of the many lessons contained in Christ's Passion that the Church celebrates so solemnly Holy Week and recommends the devotion of the Way of the Cross.
    
- Our Lord died on Good Friday. On the following Sunday He rose gloriously from the tomb in which His body had been placed. Thus, He proved to the world the truth of His teachings, especially the doctrine that He is true God. There have always been men who denied the fact of Christ's Resurrection; but the proofs for it are so convincing that no reasonable person can doubt it. After His death on the cross He appeared on many occasions, eleven of which are mentioned in the Bible. Once He was seen by more than five hundred persons. He spoke with the disciples, ate with them, and allowed them to touch the wounds in His hands and side. The very fact that the disciples willingly endured sufferings and death, in testimony of the Resurrection, is a convincing proof that it took place, for men will not die for a cause unless they are sure of it.
    
- To commemorate Christ's Resurrection, the Church celebrates Easter Sunday as one of the greatest and most joyous feasts of the year, and continues the Easter season for forty days in memory of the forty days Our Lord remained on earth. During this time the large paschal candle is kept in the sanctuary, as a symbol of the risen Christ; and to remind us of His Ascension into heaven, it is extinguished after the Gospel of the Mass on Ascension Thursday. His Ascension into heaven occurred on the fortieth day after His Resurrection.
    
- In heaven Our Lord, even as man, is King of the entire universe. At the end of the world, He will come to judge all mankind, as He Himself describes it in the twenty-fifth chapter of the Gospel of St. Matthew. There He says that at this last judgment He will place the just on His right and the wicked on His left. To the latter He will say: "Depart from me, accursed ones, into the everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels," while to the former He will give the consoling invitation: "Come, blessed of my Father, take possession of the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world" (Matthew, 25:34-41).
    
- The thought of Christ's sufferings and of His glorification should remind us that if we patiently accept the sufferings God allows to befall us, we shall merit one day to share in the glory and happiness of our divine Redeemer.

#### B. PROBLEMS AND EXERCISES.

*(Answer the questions orally or write them as your teacher may direct):*

- From what evil did Our Lord rescue us?
- How did Our Lord prove after His Resurrection that His body could pass through other bodies?
- Give three names for the place where Christ was crucified?
- Griselda, reading an extract from St. Alphonsus' "The Passion and Death of Our Lord" is surprised to learn that a single tear shed by the Infant Jesus, or a baby cry from His lips, would have been sufficient to ransom a thousand worlds as sinful as ours. Can you tell her why? Then add to your explanation a reason why Our Lord suffered so much.
- On Good Friday afternoon, what remark did Our Saviour make to the Good Thief, Dismas? When did the Good Thief enter heaven? On his way thither did he pass through either purgatory or limbo, or did he go directly to heaven? State the reason for your answer.
- What is meant by limbo? Are any souls that were once in limbo now in the hell of the damned? Explain your answer.
- Is Christ a King only as God or only as man, or as both?
- In heaven, how is Our Lord exalted over the entire universe? What October feast commemorates this exaltation? What phrase of the Apostles' Creed expresses this exaltation?
- Pascal is curious to know if the "Easter season" mentioned in the third paragraph of this lesson's commentary is the same as the "Easter Duty season?" Explain matters to him.
- Hazel, an unbelieving college professor, flippantly denies an afterlife, remarking: "No one ever came back to tell us about it!" Euphemia, the only Catholic girl in her class, remembers this lesson in Catechism, and makes an appropriate answer. What is her answer?
- Albert asks what Our Lord chiefly proved by His return from the dead? Give him your answer.
- About how many people, at the very least, saw Our Lord after He had returned from the dead? During the almost six weeks Our Lord remained on earth after Easter, on at least how many different occasions did He appear to His followers, and deal with them?
- Thelma is always deeply impressed by the services of Holy Week. Why does the Church celebrate them so solemnly?
- Marius always carries with him a small pocket crucifix. Do you approve this practice? Why?
- Our Lord's dead body was in the tomb from Good Friday until Easter Sunday. During that time was His body worthy of the highest form of adoration, the same type of adoration that is due to His living human nature today? Give the reason for your answer, remembering that the reason why Christ's human nature is given divine adoration is the fact that it is united to the Divine Person of the Word.
- Ethelreda has contracted marriage with a very wealthy non-Catholic, and has two children. Before her marriage she was a devout Catholic, but now she has given up many of her previous religious practices, though she still claims to be a good Catholic. She will not have a crucifix on the wall of any of the rooms in her house, because she asserts that the representation of the cruel sufferings inflicted on Our Lord will have a terrifying and depressing effect on the minds of her children. What do you think of her argument against the presence of a crucifix in her home?

## Lesson 9: The Holy Ghost and Grace `(Chúa Thánh Thần và Ân Sủng)`

> " ... I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY GHOST ... "

### Q. 105. Who is the Holy Ghost?

**A.** The Holy Ghost is God and the third Person of the Blessed Trinity.

- The Holy Ghost is also called the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete, the Advocate, the Spirit of Truth, the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of Love.

> `"But Peter` -> *Notes:Đoạn này bị thiếu*

### Q. 106. From whom does the Holy Ghost proceed?

**A.** The Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son.

- The Holy Ghost does not proceed from the Father and the Son by spiritual generation. Only the Son proceeds from the Father by generation. This is one of the mysterious truths that we know only from revelation.

> `"But when the Advocate has come, whom I will send you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness concerning me" (John 15:26).`

> `"But when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will teach you all the truth. For he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he will hear he will speak, and the things that are to come he will declare to you. He will glorify me, because he will receive of what is mine and declare it to you.`  
> `All things that the Father has are mine. That is why I have said that he will receive of what is mine, and will declare it to you" (John 16:13-15).`

### Q. 107. Is the Holy Ghost equal to the Father and the Son?

**A.** The Holy Ghost is equal to the Father and the Son, because He is God.

- Because of the oneness of nature in the Blessed Trinity, the Father is entirely in the Son and in the Holy Ghost; the Son is entirely in the Father and in the Holy Ghost; and the Holy Ghost is entirely in the Father and in the Son. No one of the three divine Persons is outside the other, for none precedes the other in eternity, nor surpasses the other in power, nor exceeds the other in any way. This indwelling of one divine Person in the others is called Circumincession.

> `"Jesus answered, 'Amen, amen, I say to thee, unless; a man be born again of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God' " (John 3:5).`

### Q. 108. What does the Holy Ghost do for the salvation of mankind?

**A.** The Holy Ghost dwells in the Church as the source of its life and sanctifies souls through the gift of grace.

- Although the sanctification of mankind, like all other outward works of God, is performed by all three Persons of the Blessed Trinity, it is attributed to the Holy Ghost, the third Person. The sanctification of mankind is attributed to the Holy Ghost because He is the love of the Father and the Son and because the sanctification of man by grace shows forth God's boundless love.

> `"And I will ask the Father and he will give you another Advocate to dwell with you forever, the Spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you shall know him, because he will dwell with you, and be in you" (John 14:16-17).`

> `"Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?"(1 Corinthians 3:16).`

> `"Guard the good trust through the Holy Spirit, who dwells in us" (2 Timothy 1:14).`

> `"But when the goodness and kindness of God our Savior appeared, then, not by reason of good works that we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us through the bath of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit; whom he has abundantly poured out upon us through Jesus Christ our Savior, in order that, justified by his grace, we may be heirs in the hope of life everlasting" (Titus 3:4-7).`

### Q. 109. What is grace?

**A.** Grace is a supernatural gift of God bestowed on us through the merits of Jesus Christ for our salvation.

- Grace is something real, just as the soul itself is real. It is not merely the absence of sin but rather a spiritual quality infused by God into the soul.
    
- The supernatural is that which surpasses the power of all created nature. It is of two kinds: first, that manifested when the supernatural fact happens in a manner that is beyond the power of nature; for example, when a person is instantly cured of leprosy; second, that manifested when the supernatural fact, in its essential character, completely surpasses the power of the whole natural order; for example, when, in some degree, God intimately shares His life with man through sanctifying grace.
    
- Because no man has a strict right to share in the life of God Himself, grace is a free gift, distributed by God according to His good pleasure. Jesus Christ, the Redeemer promised by God to Adam and Eve after their fall, merited all the graces since bestowed upon men. The graces bestowed by God on those who lived before the time of Christ were granted through anticipation of the merits of Our Lord.
    
- Man cannot attain eternal life by powers that are merely natural. He must be elevated to a supernatural plane through grace; and he constantly needs the impulse of God to merit eternal life.
    

> `"And of his fullness we have all received, grace for grace. For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ" (John 1:16-17).`

> `"And he said, 'this is why I have said to you, 'No one can come to me unless he is enabled to do so by my Father' " (John 6:66).`

> `"But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace in me has not been fruitless-in fact I have labored more than any of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me" (1 Corinthians 15:10).`

***The Descent of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost***

*This picture shows the Cenacle where the apostles and disciples, waiting for the coming of the Holy Spirit, were praying with the Holy Virgin and several holy women. As St. says in the of the Apostles:*

> "And when the days of Pentecost were drawing to a close, they were all together in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a violent wind blowing, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. And there appeared to them parted tongues as of fire, which settled upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in foreign tongues, even as the Holy Spirit prompted them to speak." (Acts 2:1-4)

### Q. 110. How many kinds of grace are there?

**A.** There are two kinds of grace: sanctifying grace and actual grace.

### Q. 111. What is sanctifying grace?

**A.** Sanctifying grace is that grace which confers on our souls a new life, that is, a sharing in the life of God Himself.

- Sanctifying grace is also called habitual grace because we possess this divine gift as a habit of the soul, that is, as something permanent. Sanctifying grace is lost only through mortal sin.

> `"But to as many as received him he gave the power of becoming sons of God" (John 1:12).`

> `"For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision but a new creation is of any account" (Galatians 6:15).`

> `" ... through which he has granted us the very great and precious promises. So that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption of that lust which is in the world" (2 Peter 1:4).`

### Q. 112. What are the chief effects of sanctifying grace?

**A.** The chief effects of sanctifying grace are: first, it makes us holy and pleasing to God; second, it makes us adopted children of God; third, it makes us temples of the Holy Ghost; fourth, it gives us the right to heaven.

> `"Jesus answered and said to him, 'If anyone love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him' " (John 14:23).`

> `"For whoever are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. Now you have not received a spirit of bondage so as to be again in fear, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons, by virtue of which we cry, 'Abba! Father!' "`  
> `"The Spirit himself gives testimony to our spirit that we are sons of God. But if we are sons, we are heirs also: heirs indeed of God and joint heirs with Christ, provided, however, we suffer with him that we may also be glorified with him" (Romans 8:16-17).`

> `"Or do you not know that your members are the temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own? For you have been bought at a great price. Glorify God and bear him in your body" (1 Corinthians 6:19-20).`

> `"Therefore, since we receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken, we have grace, through which we may offer pleasing service to God with fear and reverence" (Hebrews 12:28).`

> `"Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God; and such we are" (1 John 3:1).`

### Q. 113. What is actual grace?

**A.** Actual grace is a supernatural help of God which enlightens our mind and strengthens our will to do good and to avoid evil.

- Unlike sanctifying grace, actual grace is not a habit dwelling in the soul but a divine impulse moving a person to perform acts above his natural powers.
    
- A true Christian should view all his life in the light of grace. Under the general term of grace fall all the gifts that God freely bestows on man for his eternal salvation. For example, such external graces as a good mother and father, a Christian home, and even sickness and trials, must be accepted as ordained or permitted by Divine Providence for man's salvation.
    
- Persons in mortal sin cannot gain sanctifying grace without the help of actual grace. Christ, by His death, merited sufficient grace for all men to be saved.
    

> `"I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in me, and I in him, he bears much fruit; for without me you can do nothing" (John 15:5).`

> `" ... that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may grant you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in deep knowledge of him: the eyes of your mind being enlightened, so that you may know what is the hope of his calling, what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints" (Ephesians 1:17-18).`

> `"For it is God who of his good pleasure works in you both the will and the performance" (Philippians 2:13).`

### Q. 114. Can we resist the grace of God?

**A.** We can resist the grace of God, for our will is free, and God does not force us to accept His grace.

- Although God wishes the salvation of all men, those who have attained the use of reason can be saved only by cooperating freely with the grace of God. Those who do not have the use of reason cannot choose to cooperate with God's grace. They can, however, be saved through Baptism.

> `"He that could have transgressed and hath not transgressed: and could do evil things and hath not done them" (Ecclesiasticus 31:10).`

> `"Jerusalem, Jerusalem! Thou who killest the prophets, and stonest those who are sent to thee! How often would I have gathered thy children as a hen gathers her young under her wings, but thou wouldst not!" (Matthew 23:37).`

> `"Yes, working together with him we entreat you not to receive the grace of God in vain" (2 Corinthians 6:1).`

### Q. 115. Why is sanctifying grace necessary for salvation?

**A.** Sanctifying grace is necessary for salvation because it is the supernatural life, which alone enables us to attain the supernatural happiness of heaven.

- Without sanctifying grace, the soul is unworthy to see God face to face. If the soul is in the state of mortal sin, it deserves eternal punishment.

### Q. 116. Is actual grace necessary for all who have attained the use of reason?

**A.** Actual grace is necessary for all who have attained the use of reason, because without it we cannot long resist the power of temptation or perform other actions which merit a reward in heaven.

- The possession of sanctifying grace is also necessary in order to resist temptations for a long time.

> `"As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it remain on the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in me. I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in me, and I in him, he bears much fruit; for without me you can do nothing" (John 15:4-5).`

> `"God is faithful and will not permit you to be tempted beyond your strength, but with the temptation will also give you a way out that you may be able to bear it" (1 Corinthians 10:13).`

> `"Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything, as from ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God" (2 Corinthians 3:5).`

### Q. 117. What are the principal ways of obtaining grace?

**A.** The principal ways of obtaining grace are prayer and the sacraments, especially the Holy Eucharist.

- The sacraments of Baptism and Penance were instituted chiefly to give grace to those who do not possess it; the other sacraments, to increase it in those who are already in the state of grace.

> `"For we were buried with him by means of Baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ has arisen from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also may walk in newness of life" (Romans 6:4).`

### Q. 118. How can we make our most ordinary actions merit a heavenly award?

**A.** We can make our most ordinary actions merit a heavenly reward by doing them for the love of God and by keeping ourselves in the state of grace.

- Supernatural merit is the right to a heavenly reward given to us by God for good actions in the supernatural order, provided we are in the state of grace. We can merit in this life only when we are in the state of sanctifying grace and perform good works freely. After death merit cannot be gained in heaven, in hell, or in purgatory. By mortal sin a person loses the merit of his good actions.

> `"Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or do anything else, do all for the glory of God" (1 Corinthians 10:31).`

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT THE HOLY GHOST AND GRACE

- Although all three Persons of the Blessed Trinity perform the work of sanctifying human souls, this work is especially attributed to the third Person, the Holy Ghost, because He is the Person who proceeds from the Father and the Son as the breathing of their love; and sanctification is a work of love. God Himself indicated this when He attributed the
    
- Incarnation, the source of all man's sanctity, to the Holy Ghost, saying to the Blessed Virgin Mary, through the message of the Angel Gabriel: "The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee" (Luke 1:35).
    
- God sanctifies the human soul by the supernatural gift of grace. The most exalted type of grace is sanctifying grace, which is a spiritual quality, dwelling in the soul, making it like God Himself. The New Testament is filled with allusions to this grace, which is referred to as a new life, a sharing in God's life. Our Lord spoke of the reception of this life as a spiritual birth, when He said: "Unless a man be born again of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" (John 3:5). Once it has been received, sanctifying grace remains in the soul unless it is driven out by mortal sin. And when one has received sanctifying grace, he can grow in it constantly, for it increases with every worthy reception of a sacrament, and with every supernaturally meritorious work.
    
- Actual grace, as the name indicates, is given for the performance of a good, supernatural action. It is a direct force from God Himself. It contains an enlightenment of the mind and an inspiration of the will. We should be very careful not to neglect it, for it is a precious gift of God, and if we neglect one such grace we may deprive ourselves of a whole chain of extraordinary graces that God had planned for us. Even sinners receive actual graces, impelling them to turn again to God. Indeed, without actual grace, we cannot perform any supernaturally good action; for our natural powers are unable to rise to the supernatural plane.
    
- God does not distribute actual graces equally to all; some persons receive much more than others. There is no injustice in this on the part of God, for grace is a free gift from Him, and He can distribute it according to His good pleasure. But all receive sufficient grace to be saved.
    
- The chief fruit of sanctifying grace is merit - a claim or right to receive an increase of sanctifying grace, together with a claim to a corresponding measure of glory and happiness in heaven. We can increase in heavenly merit indefinitely. Not only works which are by their nature good, such as prayer and the reception of the sacraments and attendance at Mass, but even the ordinary works of our day, such as the taking of our meals, study, our games and amusements, can become meritorious if we perform them under the proper conditions. These conditions are very easy - we must be in the state of grace, and offer our works to God out of love for Him. We do not have to make this offering with each work we perform. It is sufficient to make it from time to time, particularly every morning, intending to include in it all our thoughts, words and actions. Thus, it would suffice to say in our heart: "O my God, I offer Thee every deliberate action I shall perform, because I love Thee on account of Thy infinite goodness".
    
- A person in mortal sin cannot merit any heavenly reward, even though he may perform very good deeds; but by performing good deeds from a supernatural motive, he can prepare himself for repentance and for a return to the state of sanctifying grace.
    

### RESOLUTION

- Resolve out of love for God to offer Him frequently all the actions of the entire day, even the slightest.

She also writes that when a person is in mortal sin he cannot receive any actual graces. Finally, she asserts that the good works a person performs when he is in mortal sin will become meritorious when he returns to the state of sanctifying grace. What do you think of the correctness of Helen's answers?
- Justin wonders if many venial sins will add up to constitute a mortal sin- in other words, if a person will lose the state of grace by committing many venial sins, even though he does not commit any mortal sin. Can you answer Justin's question from the information given in the commentary on this lesson?

## Lesson 10: The Virtues and the Gifts of the Holy Ghost `(Các Đức tính và Ân Huệ của Chúa Thánh Thần)`

### Q. 119. What are the chief supernatural powers that are bestowed on our souls with sanctifying grace?

**A.** The chief supernatural powers that are bestowed on our souls with sanctifying grace are the three theological virtues and the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost.

- A virtue is a habit or permanent disposition which inclines a person to do good and to avoid evil. Virtues may be natural or supernatural. Natural virtues are acquired by frequent repetition of the same act; supernatural virtues are infused into the soul directly by God.
    
- Like sanctifying grace, the three theological virtues and the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost are supernatural habits. They are called "powers" because they enable us to perform supernatural acts that lead to God. Whoever is in the state of grace has the theological virtues and the gifts of the Holy Ghost, which are infused into the intellect and will by God.
    

> `"For this reason I bend my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, from whom all fatherhood in heaven and on earth receives its name, that he may grant you from his glorious riches to be strengthened with power through his Spirit unto the progress of the inner man; and to have Christ dwelling through faith in your hearts: so that, being rooted and grounded in love, you may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know Christ's love which surpasses knowledge, in order that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God" (Ephesians 3:14-19).`

> *`See Scripture, question 108, Titus 3:4-7).`*

### Q. 120. Why are these virtues called theological virtues?

**A.** These virtues are called theological virtues because they have God for their proper object.

- All virtue has God for its last end, but not every virtue refers directly to Him. Some virtues deal directly with human things; for example, justice is concerned with human rights, such as the right to life and property. The virtues referring immediately to God are called theological, a term derived from the Greek word for God, Theos.

### Q. 121. What are the three theological virtues?

**A.** The three theological virtues are faith, hope, and charity.

> `"So there abide faith, hope and charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity" (1 Corinthians 13:13).`

### Q. 122. What is faith?

**A.** Faith is the virtue by which we firmly believe all the truths God has revealed, on the word of God revealing them, who can neither deceive nor be deceived.

- To believe is to assent to a truth on the word of another, even though it is not understood. A judge or jury believes the testimony of a witness. Such an obvious truth as two and two are four is not believed; it is understood. To understand is to assent to a truth because our intellect sees that it is true.
    
- To believe a mystery that can be known to us only because God has revealed it is to assent to it on divine faith. We believe men in human affairs; we should not find it difficult to believe God, even in matters we cannot understand, since God can neither deceive nor be deceived.
    
- To make a supernatural act of faith, one must have the help of grace. Grace enables one to have sufficient enlightenment and good will to accept God's word for what He has revealed.
    
- Our faith must have these qualities: first, it must be firm; to be doubtful deliberately on matters of faith is equivalent to denying outright God's authority. Faith should not be confused with opinion, which considers an opposing statement as probably true. Saint Paul tells us, "Faith is the substance of things to be hoped for, the evidence of things that are not seen" (Hebrews 11:1). When he speaks of evidence, he means that faith must be firm and certain. When he speaks of the things that are not seen, he means that faith is obscure; second, it must be complete; our faith must include all the truths God has revealed. To accept one truth and deny another is equivalent to denying all the truths He has revealed.
    
- Without faith it is impossible to be saved. Adults must have the virtue and the act of faith; infants must have the virtue of faith, received in Baptism, although they are incapable of making an act of faith. When children are baptized in infancy they receive, along with sanctifying grace, the infused virtue of faith. This virtue supplies them with the supernatural power they will need to make an act of faith when they have reached the age of reason.
    

> `"He said to them, 'but who do you say that I am?' Simon Peter`

> `"He who comes from above is over all. He who is from the earth belongs to earth, and of the earth he speaks. He who comes from heaven is over all. And he bears witness to that which he has seen and heard, and his witness no one receives. He who receives his witness has set his seal on this, that God is true" (John 3:31-33).`

> `"Blessed are they who have not seen, and yet have believed" (John 20:29).`

> `"If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; for this is the testimony of God which is greater, that he has borne witness concerning his Son" (1 John 5:9).`

> `"Now faith is the substance of things to be hoped for, the evidence of things that are not seen; for by it the men of old had testimony borne to them" (Hebrews 11:1-2).`

### Q. 123. What is hope?

**A.** Hope is the virtue by which we firmly trust that God, who is all powerful and faithful to His promises, will in His mercy give us eternal happiness and the means to obtain it.

- With the help of God man can gain heaven, a goal he could never attain of himself. In Sacred Scripture God promised to give man eternal life and the means to obtain it: "... he that putteth his trust in me shall inherit the land and shall possess my holy mount" (Isaias 57:13).
    
- Hope is absolutely necessary for salvation; adults must have the virtue and make the act of hope; infants must have the virtue. For the infused virtue of hope, like the infused virtue of faith, is given to the infant when he receives sanctifying grace.
    
- Our hope must be firm, since the motive for hope is God's almighty power, and since it is certain that God will give us sufficient means to obtain salvation. The firmness of hope founded in God does not exclude a reasonable fear of losing our souls because, ordinarily, we cannot be certain that we shall properly use the means of salvation.
    

> `"But hope that is seen is not hope. For how can a man hope for what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience" (Romans 8:24-25).`

> `"Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope and in the power of the Holy Spirit" (Romans 15:13).`

> `"Christ is faithful as the Son over his own house. We are that house, if we hold fast our confidence and the hope in which we glory unto the end" (Hebrews 3:6).`

> `"This hope we have, as a sure and firm anchor of the soul, reaching even behind the veil where our forerunner Jesus has entered for us, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchisedech" (Hebrews 6:19-20).`

### Q. 124. What is charity?

**A.** Charity is the virtue by which we love God above all things for His own sake, and our neighbor as ourselves for the love of God.

- Charity is called the queen of the virtues because it unites man to God most perfectly and most permanently in the bonds of love. Charity is the divine friendship uniting man to God and man to fellow-man in the bonds of mutual affection. As we love those who are truly our friends, for their own sake and not because of any advantage to us, so through charity, we love God for His own sake and our neighbor because of God.
    
- Our neighbor includes all living human beings, even our enemies, and the souls in purgatory, the blessed in heaven, and the angels. The infused virtue of charity corresponds to the infused virtues of faith and hope. Like faith and hope it is given with sanctifying grace. When God gives us the infused virtue of charity, He gives us the means to make perfect acts of love, and the power to make these acts easily.
    
- We should frequently make acts of perfect love and open our hearts to God as friend to friend in intimate conversation. To love God above all things we must be willing to renounce all created things rather than offend God by mortal sin. It is not necessary that we have more feeling in our love of God than in our love of men, since love is essentially a matter of the will, not of the feelings.
    
- We return God's friendly love by making acts of perfect love, by promoting in ourselves and others an appreciation of His infinite goodness, and by striving to live constantly for Him. Faith and hope will cease once we have attained heaven, for we cannot believe what we see, and we cannot desire and hope for what we already have; but charity remains even in heaven, where we will love God whom we possess.
    

> `"If I should speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have charity, I have become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal. And if I have prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, yet do not have charity, I am nothing. And if I distribute all my goods to feed the poor, and if I deliver my body to be burned, yet do not have charity, it profits me nothing. Charity is patient, is kind; charity does not envy, is not pretentious, is not puffed up, is not ambitious, is not self-seeking, is not provoked; thinks no evil, does not rejoice over wickedness, but rejoices with the truth; bears with all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things" (1 Corinthians 13:1-7).`

### Q. 125. Which are the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost?

**A.** The seven gifts of the Holy Ghost are: wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord.

- The gifts are infused with sanctifying grace. The Holy Ghost dwells in the souls of the just and He is never present without His gifts.

> `"And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him: the spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the spirit of counsel and of fortitude, the spirit of knowledge and of godliness. And he shall be filled with the spirit of the fear of the Lord" (Isaias 11:2-3).`

### Q. 126. How do the gifts of the Holy Ghost help us?

**A.** The gifts of the Holy Ghost help us by making us more alert to discern and more ready to do the will of God.

- The difference between the virtues and the gifts of the Holy Ghost consists in this, that the virtues help us to follow the guidance of our reason and faith, and the gifts help us to follow readily the inspirations of the Holy Spirit.

### Q. 127. Which are some of the effects in us of the gifts of the Holy Ghost?

**A.** Some of the effects in us of the gifts of the Holy Ghost are the fruits of the Holy Ghost and the beatitudes.

- Beatitude, or happiness, consists in attaining what is desired. Man, notwithstanding human suffering, can gain a very real but supernatural happiness from the possession of God in this life through grace and charity. Man hopes for everlasting happiness in heaven, where suffering is excluded.

### Q. 128. Which are the twelve fruits of the Holy Ghost?

**A.** The twelve fruits of the Holy Ghost are: charity, joy, peace, patience, benignity, goodness, long-suffering, mildness, faith, modesty, continency, and chastity.

- The fruits of the Holy Ghost are good works performed under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and with a certain delight.

> `"But the fruit of the Spirit is: charity, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith, modesty, continency" (Galatians 5:22-23).`

### Q. 129. Which are the eight beatitudes?

**A.** The eight beatitudes are:

1.  Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
2.  Blessed are the meek, for they shall possess the earth.
3.  Blessed are they who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
4.  Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for justice, for they shall be satisfied.
5.  Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
6.  Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see God.
7.  Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God.
8.  Blessed are they who suffer persecution for justice' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven

- The eight beatitudes were announced by Our Saviour at the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5:3-10). They are called beatitudes because the practicing of them will bring us happiness both on earth and in heaven.

### Q. 130. Are there any other virtues besides the theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity?

**A.** Besides the theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity there are other virtues, called moral virtues.

### Q. 131. Why are these virtues called moral virtues?

**A.** These virtues are called moral virtues because they dispose us to lead moral, or good, lives by aiding us to treat persons and things in the right way, that is, according to the will of God.

- The word moral generally signifies a way of acting, whether good or bad. It is sometimes used to mean good actions or things as opposed to immoral or evil actions and things.

### Q. 132. Which are the chief moral virtues?

**A.** The chief moral virtues are prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance; these are called cardinal virtues.

> `"And if a man love justice, her labours have great virtues. For she teacheth temperance and prudence and justice and fortitude, which are such things as men can have nothing more profitable in life" (Wisdom 8:7).`

### Q. 133. Why are these virtues called cardinal virtues?

**A.** These virtues are called cardinal virtues because they are like hinges on which hang all the other moral virtues and our whole moral life. The word "cardinal" is derived from the Latin word "cardo" meaning hinge.

- They are called cardinal or chief virtues not because they are the highest or even the most important virtues, but because all the other moral virtues depend upon them.

### Q. 134. How do prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance dispose us to lead good lives?

**A.** Prudence disposes us in all circumstances to form right judgments about what we must do or not do.

- Justice disposes us to give everyone what belongs to him.
    
- Fortitude disposes us to do what is good in spite of any difficulty.
    
- Temperance disposes us to control our desires and to use rightly the things which please our senses.
    
- Prudence perfects the intelligence, which is the power of forming judgments. Knowledge and experience are important for prudence.
    
- Justice perfects the will and safeguards the chief rights of man: his right to life and freedom, to the sanctity of the home, to his good name and honor, and to his external possessions.
    
- Fortitude is especially important when one is in danger of death. Martyrs are the best examples of those who possess this virtue. Fortitude urges us forward in the face of trying difficulties.
    
- Temperance is especially necessary in moderating the use of food and drink, and in regulating the enjoyment of sex in the married state.
    

> `"Get wisdom, because it is better than gold: and purchase prudence, for it is more precious than silver" (Proverbs 16:16).`

> `"He that followeth justice and mercy shall find life, justice, and glory" (Proverbs 21:21).`

> `"Use as a frugal man the things that are set before thee: lest if thou eatest much, thou be hated" (Ecclesiasticus 31:19).`

> `"Wine was created from the beginning to make men joyful, and not to make them drunk" (Ecclesiasticus 31:35).`

> `"Or do you not know that the unjust will not possess the kingdom of God? Do not err; neither fornicators...nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor the evil-tongued, nor the greedy will possess the kingdom of God" (1 Corinthians 6:9-10).`

### Q. 135. Which are some of the other moral virtues?

**A.** Some of the other moral virtues are:

- Filial piety and patriotism, which dispose us to honor, love, and respect our parents and our country.
- Obedience, which disposes us to do the will of our superiors.
- Veracity, which disposes us to tell the truth.
- Liberality, which disposes us rightly to use worldly goods.
- Patience, which disposes us to bear up under trials and difficulties.
- Humility, which disposes us to acknowledge our limitations.
- Chastity, or purity, which disposes us to be pure in soul and body.
- Besides these, there are many other moral virtues.
- Religion is the highest moral virtue since it disposes us to offer to God the worship that is due Him. Religion, therefore, is rightly classed under the cardinal virtue of justice.

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT THE VIRTUES AND GIFTS OF THE HOLY GHOST

- When God sanctifies a soul, He gives it not only the sublime supernatural quality by which it is made like to Him and shares in His divine life- sanctifying grace-but also a number of other qualities or habits by which the soul can act supernaturally. These are called the supernatural virtues and the gifts of the Holy Ghost. These supernatural habits are said to be infused by God-that is, poured into the soul. They are given in proportion to each one's measure of sanctifying grace, and they increase proportionately with the increase of that grace. The supernatural virtues do not destroy the natural virtues which one may have acquired by repeated good acts, but rather strengthen and perfect them. Neither do the supernatural virtues free one from the obligation of acquiring the natural virtues. The ideal Christian has both natural and supernatural virtues. However, it is possible to have one type without the other. Thus, a baptized infant has the supernatural virtues, infused at Baptism, but he has no natural virtues. On the other hand, a sinner, who has not the supernatural moral virtues may have some natural virtues.
    
- The noblest of the supernatural virtues are the three theological virtues, faith, hope and charity, by which the soul believes in God's revelations, hopes to possess Him for all eternity, and loves Him because of His infinite goodness. The infused moral virtues help one to use created things properly, employing them so as to gain eternal life from their use. These virtues, like the corresponding natural virtues, are grouped under the four chief or cardinal virtues of prudence, justice, fortitude and temperance. Finally, the gifts of the Holy Ghost make one docile to the movements of the Holy Spirit. Every good Christian knows that at times he chooses a certain course of action or performs a good deed so suddenly that it would seem that he is impelled by a power outside of himself; and afterwards he realizes that it was the proper thing to do. This is a manifestation of the activity of the Holy Ghost, working on the soul through His gifts. Often we find Catholics who believe that the gifts of the Holy Ghost are given only in Confirmation; but this is incorrect. They are always given with sanctifying grace, though the sacrament of Confirmation, since it makes us soldiers of Christ, urges us to use the gifts in a special degree.
    
- The greatest of the theological virtues is charity, which is love for God because of His infinite goodness and love for our neighbor because he shares, or can share, in the goodness of God through the possession of sanctifying grace. Our Lord told us that we must love God with our whole heart and soul, which means that we must be willing to renounce every created good rather than offend God by mortal sin. We can have true love for God even though we are not sorry for our venial sins, though it is surely more perfect to repent of our venial as well as our mortal sins when we make an act of love for God. The goodness of God which is the motive of charity is His supernatural goodness, which is made known through revelation.
    
- Similarly, love for our neighbor, to be charity, must be based on a supernatural motive-namely, the fact that every one of our fellow men either possesses sanctifying grace or is capable of possessing it. If we love a person merely because of his natural qualities, we are not making an act of charity. When Our Lord told us to love our neighbor as ourselves, He meant that we must love all our fellow men in the same manner as we love ourselves - that is, supernaturally - but not necessarily in the same measure. Moreover, we are not obliged to love all our fellow men in the same degree. We can and should have greater love for those who are united to us by the bonds of relationship, faith and nationality.
    
- As long as we retain sanctifying grace, the infused virtues and the gifts remain in our soul. Mortal sin drives out all these supernatural habits, except faith and hope, which remain even in the soul of the sinner unless he commits a sin directly against hope-in which case only faith remains- or a sin directly opposed to faith, in which case all the supernatural qualities are driven out.
    
- St. Paul in the Epistle to the (5:22-23) speaks of the fruits of the Holy Ghost-acts of virtue which bring sweetness and joy to the soul, like delicious fruit. Our Lord has given us the beatitudes (Matthew 5:310), eight principles concerning the practice of virtue in an exalted manner, which will bring us happiness and peace. The Church is constantly urging her members to the practice of virtue. The first condition required in the process of canonization, or declaring one a saint, is to prove that this person practiced the theological and moral virtues in a heroic or extraordinary degree.
    

### RESOLUTION

- Resolve to make progress in virtue every day. It is best to center one's attention on a particular virtue, especially that which we find most difficult to practice, and perform acts of this virtue whenever the opportunity is offered.

## Lesson 11: The Catholic Church `(Giáo hội Công giáo)`

> "I BELIEVE IN ... THE HOLY CATHOLIC CHURCH ... "

### Q. 136. What is the Church?

**A.** The Church is the congregation of all baptized persons united in the same true faith, the same sacrifice, and the same sacraments, under the authority of the Sovereign Pontiff and the bishops in communion with him.

- Since Baptism, according to the ruling of Christ, is the gateway to the Church, a person becomes a member of the Church on receiving this sacrament. To remain a real member of the Church after Baptism a person must profess the one true faith and must not withdraw from the unity of the body of the Church in schism or heresy or be excommunicated by legitimate authority because of serious sins. Even schismatics, heretics, and those excommunicated are subjects of the Church and are obliged by its laws unless exempted by the Church.
    
- Sacred Scripture refers to the Church as the Body of Christ, as a sheepfold, as the kingdom of God, and as the kingdom of heaven.
    

> `"The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field ... " (Matthew 13:24).`

> `"But if I cast out devils by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you" (Luke 11:20).`

> `"I am the good shepherd, and I know mine and mine know me, even as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for my sheep. And other sheep I have that are not of this fold. Them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice, and there shall be one fold and one shepherd" (John 10:14-16).`

> `"For as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, many as they are, form one body, so also is it with Christ ... Now you are the body of Christ, member for member" (1 Corinthians 12:12, 27).`

> `" ... one body and one Spirit, even as you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one Baptism; one God and Father of all" (Ephesians 4:4-6).`

### Q. 137. Who founded the Church?

**A.** Jesus Christ founded the Church.

- Christ completed the founding of His Church just before His Ascension, when He commissioned the apostles to make disciples of all nations. Earlier in His public ministry He had instituted the sacraments, chosen the twelve apostles, instructed them by word and example, and conferred on them the power of teaching, ruling, and sanctifying.
    
- The Gospels show that Christ founded the Church in the form of a visible, hierarchical society, that is, one made up of subjects and superiors who rightfully rule subjects. The Roman Pontiff and the bishops under him are the ruling hierarchy of the Church. The Church is also a monarchical society in which the Pope rules with full power, that is, with jurisdiction over the entire Church. Peter
    

> `"And I say to thee, thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it" (Matthew 16:18).`

> `"And Jesus drew near and spoke to them saying, 'All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and behold, I am with you all days, even unto the consummation of the world' " (Matthew 28:18-20).`

> `" ... Christ also loved the Church, and delivered himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, cleansing her in the bath of water by means of the word; in order that he might present to himself the Church in all her glory, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she might be holy and without blemish" (Ephesians 5:25-27).`

### Q. 138. Why did Jesus Christ found the Church?

**A.** Jesus Christ founded the Church to bring all men to eternal salvation.

- The Church instituted by Christ is the only way to eternal salvation. Christ gave the Church the means whereby man can be sanctified and saved.

> `"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them and they follow me. And I give them everlasting life; and they shall never perish, neither shall anyone snatch them out of my hand" (John 10:27-28).`

> `"As the Father has sent me, I also send you" (John 20:21).`

> `"For the grace of God our Savior has appeared to all men, instructing us, in order that, rejecting ungodliness and worldly lusts, we may live temperately and justly and piously in this world; looking for the blessed hope and glorious coming of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and cleanse for himself an acceptable people, pursuing good works" (Titus 2:11-14).`

### Q. 139. How is the Church enabled to lead men to salvation?

**A.** The Church is enabled to lead men to salvation by the indwelling of the Holy Ghost, who gives it life.

- Although the work of salvation is the result of the operation of all three Persons of the Blessed Trinity, it is especially the result of the Redemption by Christ, and because this work is one of divine love it is attributed to the Holy Ghost, who is the soul of the Church, of which Christ is the Head.

> `"But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be witnesses for me in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and even to the very ends of the earth" (Acts 1:8).`

### Q. 140. When was the dwelling of the Holy Ghost in the Church first visibly manifested?

**A.** The dwelling of the Holy Ghost in the Church was first visibly manifested on Pentecost Sunday, when He came down upon the apostles in the form of tongues of fire.

- The word "Pentecost" means fiftieth and is applied to the fiftieth day after Our Lord's Resurrection. The apostles were sent by Christ to preach His doctrines to all men.

> `"And when the days of Pentecost were drawing to a close, they were all together in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a violent wind blowing, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. And there appeared to them parted tongues as of fire, which settled upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in foreign tongues, even as the Holy Spirit prompted them to speak" (Acts 2:1-4).`

### Q. 141. How long will the Holy Ghost dwell in the Church?

**A.** The Holy Ghost will dwell in the Church until the end of time.

- Christ foretold that the Holy Ghost would dwell in the Church until the end of time.

> `"And I will ask the Father and he will give you another Advocate to dwell with you forever, the Spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you shall know him, because he will dwell with you, and be in you" (John 14:16-17).`

### Q. 142. Who sent the Holy Ghost to dwell in the Church?

**A.** God the Father and God the Son sent the Holy Ghost to dwell in the Church.

- It is a matter of faith that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son and is sent by Both to dwell in the Church.

> `"But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring to your mind whatever I have said to you" (John 14:26).`

> `"But when the Advocate has come, whom I will send you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness concerning me" (John 15:26).`

> `"It is expedient for you that I depart. For if I do not go, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you" (John 16:7).`

### Q. 143. What does the indwelling of the Holy Ghost enable the Church to do?

**A.** The indwelling of the Holy Ghost enables the Church to teach, to sanctify, and to rule the faithful in the name of Christ.

- The Church must teach because otherwise men would not know the truths of divine revelation taught by Christ. The Church must sanctify, that is, bring grace to the world through the sacraments, because otherwise men could not be saved. The Church must rule because it was established by Our Saviour as a society, which is inconceivable without authority.

> `"But when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will teach you all the truth. For he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he will hear he will speak, and the things that are to come he will declare to you. He will glorify me, because he will receive of what is mine and declare it to you" (John 16:13-14).`

> `"Guard the good trust through the Holy Spirit, who dwells in us" (2 Timothy 1:14).`

### Q. 144. What is meant by teaching, sanctifying, and ruling in the name of Christ?

**A.** By teaching, sanctifying, and ruling in the name of Christ is meant that the Church always does the will of its Divine Founder, who remains forever its invisible Head.

- The will of the Founder of the Church is expressed in the commission He gave to His apostles to teach all nations, to baptize them, and to have them observe all the things He had commanded. This commission, as well as the guarantee that Christ would be with His Church until the end of time, is related in the Gospel. 12

### Q. 145. To whom did Christ give the power to teach, to sanctify, and to rule the members of His Church?

**A.** Christ gave the power to teach, to sanctify, and to rule the members of His Church to the apostles, the first bishops of the Church.

- That Christ gave His apostles the power to teach, to rule, and to sanctify is evident from the Gospels, the inspired account of Our Lord's life written by Saints Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Christ gave the apostles the power to bind and loose, to baptize, to forgive sin, and to offer the sacrifice of the Mass.
    
- The power to teach and to rule is the power of jurisdiction; the power to sanctify is the power of orders. The power to sanctify sometimes requires jurisdiction, as in the sacrament of Penance.
    

> `"Go into the whole world and preach the gospel to every creature" (Mark 16:15).`

> `"He who hears you, hears me; and he who rejects you, rejects me; and he who rejects me, rejects him who sent me" (Luke 10:16).`

> `"He therefore said to them again. 'Peace be to you! As the Father has sent me, I also send you.' When he had said this, he breathed upon them, and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit; whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained' " (John 20:21-23).`

> `"You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be witnesses for me in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and even to the very ends of the earth" (Acts 1:8).`

### Q. 146. Did Christ intend that this power should be exercised by the apostles alone?

**A.** No, Christ intended that this power should be exercised also by their successors, the bishops of the Church.

- Christ founded the Church to last until the end of time. The apostles lived for a short time only. Christ must, then, have intended that the apostles provide duly authorized successors to carry on the work of teaching, sanctifying, and ruling. The of the Apostles and the Epistles of Saint Paul contain references to the work done by the successors of the apostles.

> `"And they prayed and said, 'Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all, show which of these two thou hast chosen to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell away to go to his own place.' And they drew lots between them, and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles" (Acts 1:24-26).`

> `"This saying is true: If anyone is eager for the office of bishop, he desires a good work" (1 Timothy 3:1).`

> `"For this reason I left thee in Crete, that thou shouldst set right anything that is defective and shouldst appoint presbyters in every city, as I myself directed thee to do" (Titus 1:5).`

### Q. 147. Did Christ give special power in His Church to any one of the apostles?

**A.** Christ gave special power in His Church to Saint Peter by making him the head of the apostles and the chief teacher and ruler of the entire Church.

- The power of the keys was promised to Saint Peter

> `"Then Jesus answered and said, 'Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to thee, but my Father in heaven. And I say to thee, thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven' " (Matthew 16:17-19).`

> `"And the Lord said, 'Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat. But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith may not fail; and do thou, when once thou hast turned again, strengthen thy brethren' " (Luke 22:31-32).`

> `"When, therefore, they had breakfasted, Jesus said to Simon Peter, 'Simon, son of John, dost thou love me more than these do?' He said to him, 'Yes, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee.' He said to him, 'Feed my lambs.' He said to him a second time, 'Simon, son of John, dost thou love me?' He said to him, 'Yes, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee.' He said to him, 'Feed my lambs.' A third time he said to him, 'Simon, son of John, dost thou love me?' Peter`

> `"In those days Peter`

> `"But Peter, standing up with the Eleven, lifted up his voice and spoke out to them" (Acts 2:14).`

### Q. 148. Did Christ intend that the special power of chief teacher and ruler of the entire Church should be exercised by Saint Peter alone?

**A.** Christ did not intend that the special power of chief teacher and ruler of the entire Church should be exercised by Saint Peter alone, but intended that this power should be passed down to his successor, the Pope, the Bishop of Rome, who is the Vicar of Christ on earth and the visible head of the Church.

- A successor to Saint Peter, the first Bishop of Rome, was required as chief teacher and ruler for the same reason that successors were required for the other apostles. From the very beginning it was acknowledged by the Church that the successor of Saint Peter
    
- The bishops of the Church are the successors of the apostles because they have received their power of orders by valid consecration through an unbroken line of successors of the apostles, and have received their power of jurisdiction through their union with the Pope, the successor of Saint Peter. The Pope is now elected by the College of Cardinals.
    

### Q. 149. Who assist the bishops in the care of souls?

**A.** The priests, especially parish priests, assist the bishops in the care of souls.

- Although all priests assist the bishop of a diocese in the care of souls, parish priests especially are given the definite care of a section of a diocese, which is called a parish and is of ecclesiastical institution.

> `"And when they had appointed presbyters for them in each church, with prayer and fasting, they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed" (Acts 14:22).`

### Q. 150. Who are the laity of the Church?

**A.** The laity of the Church are all its members who do not belong to the clerical or to the religious state.

- The clerical state includes all priests and all aspirants to the priesthood who have received tonsure, which is the initiation into the ecclesiastical state. Students of minor and major seminaries are aspirants to the Priesthood. The religious state includes men and women who embrace a community life and make the vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. Those who are preparing to embrace the religious state are called aspirants, postulants, or novices.
    
- Religious and clerics enjoy special canonical privileges and have many more obligations than lay people have. Among the laity are secular persons who have embraced the state of celibacy or virginity, or the matrimonial state.
    

***The Confession of St. Peter***

*This picture shows Our Lord Jesus handing over the keys to St. Peter, as a sign of the power which He was giving him to forgive sins or to retain them, as shown in the account of St. Matthew:*

> "Now Jesus, having come into the district of Caesarea Philippi, began to ask His disciples, saying, 'Who do men say the Son of Man is?' But they said, 'Some say, the Baptist; and others, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.' He said to them, 'But who do you say that I am?' Simon Peter

### Q. 151. How can the laity help the Church in her care of souls?

**A.** The laity can help the Church in her care of souls by leading lives that will reflect credit on the Church, and by co-operating with their bishops and priests, especially through Catholic Action.

- The lay people can assist in a special way by prayer. Catholic Action is the participation of the laity in the apostolate of the hierarchy of the Church. There can be no Catholic Action without an episcopal commission.

> `"Even so let your light shine before men, in order that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven" (Matthew 5:16).`

> `"I entreat Evodia and I exhort Syntyche to be of one mind in the Lord. And I beseech thee also, my loyal comrade, help them, for they have toiled with me in the gospel, as have Clement and the rest of my fellow-workers whose names are in the book of life" (Philippians 4:2-3).`

> `"Behave yourselves honorably among the pagans; that, whereas they slander you as evildoers, they may, through observing you, by reason of your good works glorify God in the day of visitation" (1 Peter 2:12).`

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH

- One of the most important articles of faith in the Catholic religion is the doctrine that Jesus Christ in the course of His lifetime on earth established a Church-that is, a visible organization which was to continue His work '" of bringing men to salvation until the end of time. This Church was to be an extension of Christ's own life and activities down through the ages. The account of Our Lord's life contained in the Gospel clearly indicates that He founded such an organization. He often spoke of it; He chose the apostles and disciples to be the first members of the Church; as time went on He made it clear that in the Church there were to be rulers who would teach, sanctify and govern the others; He made the apostles the first superiors of the Church, and gave them the power they needed for their office; He indicated that this power was to continue in their successors until the end of the world. As the chief of the apostles and the head of the Church, Christ chose Simon Peter. That Peter
- Such was the Church as Christ founded it; and such it continues to be today. The Catholic Church has remained the Church of Christ for more than nineteen centuries. It is ruled by the Pope, the successor of St. Peter
- We call that portion of the Church that is governed by a bishop a diocese. The place from which the bishop teaches and rules is called a see-for example, the see of New York, the see of Boston. The see of the Pope in Rome, because of his special dignity and authority, is called the Holy See. Every diocese is divided into parishes, and the priest in charge is called the pastor or parish priest. The priests who aid him are called assistants or curates.
- If the church were a merely human organization, it could not have survived for nineteen hundred years. But the Church is a divine organization founded by the Son of God, receiving its life from the Holy Ghost, who on Pentecost came down upon the apostles, the first bishops, to give them light and strength, and to dwell in the Church, as its soul, until the end of time. As members of the Church we all share in this divine life.
- These thoughts should urge us to be faithful to our obligations as Catholics. We should unhesitatingly accept the teachings of the Church, make use of the means of holiness the Church provides, and obey all the Church's laws, with the conviction that Christ Himself is teaching, sanctifying and ruling us through His representatives, the superiors of the Church. Above all, we should always be loyal to the Pope, the Vicar, or earthly representative, of Jesus Christ.

## Lesson 12: The Marks and Attributes of the Church `(Các Dấu chỉ và Thuộc tính của Giáo hội)`

> "I BELIEVE IN ... THE HOLY CATHOLIC CHURCH ... "

### Q. 152. Which is the one true Church established by Christ?

**A.** The one true Church established by Christ is the Catholic Church.

- Many churches which claim to be Christian have broken away from the one true Church established by Jesus Christ. These churches were founded by men who had no authority from God to found a church. Christ intended that there should be only one true Christian Church, for He always spoke of His Church as one.

> `"And other sheep I have that are not of this fold. Them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice, and there shall be one fold and one shepherd" (John 10:16).`

### Q. 153. How do we know that the Catholic Church is the one true Church established by Christ?

**A.** We know that the Catholic Church is the one true Church established by Christ because it alone has the marks of the true Church.

> `"Holy Father, keep in thy name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one even as we are" (John 17:11).`

> `"Sanctify them in the truth. Thy word is truth. Even as thou hast sent me into the world, so I also have sent them into the world. And for them I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth.`  
> `Yet not for these only do I pray, but for those also who through their word are to believe in me, that all may be one, even as thou, Father, in me and I`  
> `In thee; that they also may be one in us, that the world may believe that thou hast sent me" (John 17:17-21).`

### Q. 154. What do we mean by the marks of the Church?

**A.** By the marks of the Church we mean certain clear signs by which all men can recognize it as the true Church founded by Jesus Christ.

- Jesus Christ willed that the true Church should have these marks, which would distinguish it from all false religions.

### Q. 155. What are the chief marks of the Church?

**A.** The chief marks of the Church are four: It is one, holy, catholic or universal, and apostolic.

- Sacred Scripture teaches that the one true Church of Christ must have these marks.
- The marks of the Church are themselves an indication that God guides the Church.

### Q. 156. Why is the Catholic Church one?

**A.** The Catholic Church is one because all its members, according to the will of Christ, profess the same faith, have the same sacrifice and sacraments, and are united under one and the same visible head, the Pope.

- Our Divine Saviour prayed explicitly that His Church might be one, and He made it one; thus, men can recognize it as the true Church. Only the Catholic Church possesses this mark of unity. Various sects, having only fragments of Christianity, are divided in doctrine and practice and recognize no authority but their own judgment, which can easily lead them into error.
- (c)There are many religious sects which claim to be Christian, but are separated from the unity of Christ by their rejection of the authority invested by Him in the Roman Pontiff, the successor to Saint Peter.
- Catholics accept all the doctrines of faith and morals which were taught by Our Lord and the apostles and are proposed by the Church for belief and practice. A person who deliberately denies even one of the doctrines of the Church cannot be a Catholic. The Church is one in faith.
- Catholics take part in the same sacrifice of the Mass and accept the same sacraments, although the same language and the same ceremonies are not used by all in the offering of Mass and in the administration of the sacraments. Everywhere the essential parts of the ceremonies are the same and substantially the same words are used in offering Mass. Hence the Church is one in worship. What Christ determined, the Church cannot change. Since Christ, however, did not determine many points of worship in non-essential matters, the Church has the authority to do so.
- Catholics are subject to their respective bishops who rule them. They must recognize the supreme authority of the Pope in matters of religion. A person who deliberately refuses to accept the legitimate and supreme authority of the Pope and the bishops in matters of religion cannot be a Catholic. *(Ed. Except in the case where a Pope or Bishop teaches heresy, he should be ignored.)*

> `"For from the rising of the sun even to the going down, my name is great among the Gentiles: and in every place there is sacrifice and there is offered to my name a clean oblation" (Malachias 1:11).`

> `"For just as in one body we have many members, yet all the members have not the same function, so we, the many, are one body in Christ, but severally members one of another" (Romans 12:4-5).`

> `"Because the bread is one, we though many, are one body, all of us who partake of the one bread" (1 Corinthians 10:17).`

> `"...one body and one Spirit, even as you were called in one hope of your calling one Lord, one faith, one Baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and throughout all, and in us all" (Ephesians 4:4-6).`

> See Scripture, question 152.

### Q. 157. Why is the Catholic Church holy?

**A.** The Catholic Church is holy because it was founded by Jesus Christ, who is all-holy, and because it teaches, according to the will of Christ, holy doctrines, and provides the means of leading a holy life, thereby giving holy members to every age.

- Holiness is a mark of the Church according to the will of Christ, as is evident from the prayer of Christ for His apostles. Even some of the enemies of the Church recognize the holiness of the doctrines which the Church teaches. The efforts of others to prove that the Church is not holy show that they acknowledge holiness as a mark of truth.
- The lives of the saints, of the martyrs, and of good Catholics prove how effective are the means of grace with which the Church is endowed. Moreover, God has always favored the Catholic Church with miracles.
- Bad Catholics do not disprove the holiness of the Church since they do not use the means of grace at their disposal. Christ foretold that there would be good and bad members of His Church as we read in the parables of the fishes in the net and the cockle among the wheat.

> `"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves. By their fruits you will know them. Do men gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles? Even so, every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Therefore, by their fruits you will know them" (Matthew 7:15-20).`

> `"...looking for the blessed hope and glorious coming of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us that be might redeem us from all iniquity and cleanse for himself an acceptable people, pursuing good works" (Titus 2:13-14).`

> `"And you know that he appeared to take our sins away, and sin is not in him" (1 John 3:5).`

### Q. 158. Why is the Catholic Church catholic or universal?

**A.** The Catholic Church is catholic or universal because, destined to last for all time, it never fails to fulfill the divine commandment to teach all nations all the truths revealed by God.

- Catholicity is a mark of the Church because Christ commissioned His apostles to go forth and make disciples of all nations, and to teach all that He had commanded. Christ further promised to be with them all days, even to the end of time.
- The Church today teaches the same doctrine it received from Christ. It has existed uninterruptedly since the day it was established down to the present time. The Church exists in a more flourishing condition in some nations than in others. It is always trying to preach the gospel to all races and in all places and sends its missioners to the most remote places on earth.
- Christian sects began later and for the most part exist in only some sections of the world. In trying to accommodate themselves to the changing conditions of the time, they have made changes in the doctrines of Christ without any divine authorization.

> `"And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world, for a witness to all nations; and then will come the end" (Matthew 24:14).`

> `"And he said to them, 'Go into the whole world and preach the gospel to every creature. He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who does not believe shall be condemned' "(Mark 16:15-16).`

> `"But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be witnesses for me in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and even to the very ends of the earth" (Acts 1:8).`

> `"Faith then depends on hearing, and hearing on the word of Christ. But I say: Have they not heard? Yes, indeed, 'their voice has gone forth into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world' " (Romans 10:1718).`

### Q. 159. Why is the Catholic Church apostolic?

**A.** The Catholic Church is apostolic because it was founded by Christ on the apostles and, according to His divine will, has always been governed by their lawful successors.

- The true Church is apostolic because it is the Church Christ founded upon the apostles, and especially upon Peter

> `"And I say to thee, thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it" (Matthew 16:18).`

> `"Therefore, you now no longer are strangers and foreigners, but you citizens with the saints and members of God's household: you are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone" (Ephesians 2:19-20).`

### Q. 160. How do we know that no other church but the Catholic Church is the true Church of Christ?

**A.** We know that no other church but the Catholic Church is the true Church of Christ because no other church has these four marks.

- All other churches lack essential unity. They recognize no authority in religious matters vested in an individual who is the Vicar of Christ. In the worship of God many Christian sects are guided more by sentiment and personal conviction than by the objective truths given to the world by Our Lord.
    
- The founders of Christian sects were not saints and generally were not holy or edifying men. The sects have not given saints to the world. Their truths are but fragments of the doctrines of the Catholic Church. The holiness of their members is due to the means that the sects have salvaged from Catholic worship. Moreover, these sects cannot point to miracles wrought in their favor.
    
- Not one of the Christian sects is universal or catholic; that is, not one has universality such as that of the Catholic Church. Not one of the Christian sects can trace its origin to the apostles.
    
- The Greek Orthodox or Schismatic Church began in the ninth century with its rejection of the authority of the Pope. From it have come various national churches, subject in some degree to civil authority. The Protestant churches began in the sixteenth century when their founders, rejecting certain doctrines of faith, broke away from Catholic unity. Many Protestant denominations are offshoots of the earliest sects. The Lutherans were founded by Martin Luther, the Presbyterians by Knox, and the Methodists by Wesley.
    

### Q. 161. What are the chief attributes of the Catholic Church?

**A.** The chief attributes of the Catholic Church are authority, infallibility, and indefectibility. They are called attributes because they are qualities perfecting the nature of the Church.

### Q. 162. What is meant by the authority of the Catholic Church?

**A.** By the authority of the Catholic Church is meant that the Pope and the bishops, as the lawful successors of the apostles, have power from Christ Himself to teach, to sanctify, and to govern the faithful in spiritual matters.

- Christ Himself gave this authority to Saint Peter
    
- Outside the Church there generally is no real recognition of authority in spiritual matters and this disregard for spiritual authority has lessened the respect for civil and domestic authority.
    
- The Church has authority over temporal matters which are closely connected with spiritual matters, as the administration of Church property.
    
- The Pope, as the supreme head of the Church, cannot rightly be made a subject of any temporal power on earth. The present position of the Pope, as head of the Vatican City, shows to the world that he and his household are not the subjects of other temporal powers. When we speak of the temporal power of the Pope, we do not mean thereby merely to classify him with earthly rulers. The Pope's temporal power is a means to an end, guaranteeing that freedom of word and action which he must rightfully enjoy as the supreme spiritual ruler of the Church.
    

> `"And if he refuse to hear them, appeal to the Church, but if he refuse to hear even the Church, let him be to thee as the heathen and the publican" (Matthew 18:17).`

> `"Take heed to yourselves and to the whole flock in which the Holy Spirit has placed you as bishops, to rule the Church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood" (Acts 20:28).`

> `"On behalf of Christ, therefore, we are acting as ambassadors, God, as it were, appealing through us" (2 Corinthians 5:20).`

### Q. 163. What is meant by the infallibility of the Catholic Church?

**A.** By the infallibility of the Catholic Church is meant that the Church, by the special assistance of the Holy Ghost, cannot err when it teaches or believes a doctrine of faith or morals.

- Infallibility, especially papal infallibility, is a doctrine often misunderstood and derided by those outside the Church. The term "infallibility" is often distorted to mean impeccability, that is, freedom from all sin. The Church has never held that the Pope cannot sin.
    
- It is unthinkable that an institution established by God for the salvation of souls could lead men into error and turn them away from God. If the Church could and did err in matters of faith or morals, it would not be a true teacher; it would fail in its ministry of sanctification and would not lead men to salvation but would be responsible for their condemnation.
    
- A doctrine of faith or morals is a truth revealed by God dealing with what we must believe or what we must do in order to be saved.
    
- The Church cannot change its defined teachings on faith and morals, though it may restate them more clearly and more completely.
    
- We know that the Church is infallible in matters of faith or morals because Christ promised that He would be with the apostles and their successors in their work of teaching until the end of time. It would be impossible for Christ to be with the official teachers of the Church and permit them to teach error.
    

> `"And I will ask the Father and he will give you another Advocate to dwell with you forever, the Spirit of truth" (John 14:16).`

> `"But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring to your mind whatever I have said to you" (John 14:26).`

### Q. 164. When does the Church teach infallibly?

**A.** The Church teaches infallibly when it defines, through the Pope alone, as the teacher of all Christians, or through the Pope and the bishops, a doctrine of faith or morals to be held by all the faithful.

- The Holy Father must intend to use his supreme, apostolic authority when he teaches infallibly. The Pope can teach without speaking infallibly; for example, he does this in his encyclical letters. Catholics must accept such teachings, not on faith, but in obedience to the authority of the Pope and in respect for his wisdom.

### Q. 165. What is meant by the indefectibility of the Catholic Church?

**A.** By the indefectibility of the Catholic Church is meant that the Church, as Christ founded it, will last until the end of time.

- This indefectibility of the Church is in conformity with the will of Christ, who promised to be with His Church until the end of time.

> `"For as often as you shall eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the death of the Lord, until he comes" (1 Corinthians 11:26).`

### Q. 166. Are all obliged to belong to the Catholic Church in order to be saved?

**A.** All are obliged to belong to the Catholic Church in order to be saved.

- The principle, "It makes no difference what religion a person practices so long as he leads a good life," is deceptive because it attaches the same importance to the teaching and practice of a false religion as it does to the teaching and practice of the one, true religion revealed by Christ and taught by His Church. No one can be saved without sanctifying grace, and the Catholic Church alone is the divinely established means by which grace is brought to the world and the full fruits of Our Lord's Redemption are applied to men.

> `"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that those who believe in him may not perish, but may have life everlasting" (John 3:14-15).`

> `"Jesus said to him, 'I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father but through me' " (John 14:6).`

> `"In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God has raised from the dead, even in this name does he stand here before you, sound. This is 'The stone that was rejected by you, the builders, which has become the comer stone.' Neither is there salvation in any other. For there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved" (Acts 4:10-12).`

### Q. 167. What do we mean when we say, "Outside the Church there is no salvation?"

**A.** When we say, "Outside the Church there is no salvation," we mean that those who through their own grave fault do not know that the Catholic Church is the true Church or, knowing it, refuse to join it, cannot be saved.

- "Outside the Church there is no salvation" does not mean that everyone who is not a Catholic will be condemned. It does mean that no one can be saved unless he belongs in some manner to the Catholic Church, either actually or in desire, for the means of grace are not given without some relation to the divine institution established by Christ.

### Q. 168. Can they be saved who remain outside the Catholic Church because they do not know it is the true Church?

**A.** They who remain outside the Catholic Church through no grave fault of their own and do not know it is the true Church, can be saved by making use of the graces which God gives them.

- Those who are outside the Church through no fault of their own are not culpable in the sight of God because of their invincible ignorance. Persons who make use of the graces God gives them, even though they are not members of the true Church, actually have the desire to become members inasmuch as they wish to use all the means ordained by God for their salvation.
    
- We should pray and try to persuade others to investigate the teachings of the Catholic Church because charity obliges us to do all we can to lead others to salvation. We should also pray for Catholic missioners and help them in their work of bringing the faith to those outside the Catholic Church.
    

### Q. 169. Why is the Catholic Church called the Mystical Body of Christ?

**A.** The Catholic Church is called the Mystical Body of Christ because its members are united by supernatural bonds with one another and with Christ, their Head, thus resembling the members and head of the living human body.

> `"Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it remain on the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in me. I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in me, and I in him, he bears much fruit; for without me you can do nothing. If anyone does not abide in me, he shall be cast outside as the branch and wither; and they shall gather them up and cast them into the fire, and they shall burn. If you abide in me, and if my words abide in you, ask whatever you will and it shall be done to you" (John 15:4-7).`

> `"Yet not for these only do I pray, but for those also who through their word are to believe in me, that all may be one, even as thou, Father, in me and I in thee; that they also may be one in us, that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory that thou hast given me, I have given to them, that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me; that they may be perfected in unity" (John 17:20-23).`

> `"And all things he made subject under his feet, and him he gave as head over all the Church, which indeed is his body, the completion of him who fills all with all" (Ephesians 1:22-23).`

> `"Again, he is the head of his body, the Church" (Colossians 1:18).`

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT THE MARKS AND ATTRIBUTES OF THE CHURCH

- Since Christ founded only one Church and commanded that all men should join that Church in order to be saved, it is most important to discover which of the many churches that exist in the world is the one true Church. To discover this, we have only to pick out the distinctive qualities of the Church as Christ founded it, and then find out which of the churches has these qualities. This process is quite similar to the modern methods of identifying a person by means of his fingerprints. No two persons have the same kind of fingerprints; and so, when we have a record of a person's fingerprints, we can find him in a group by having all make their fingerprints and then examining to see which one has the fingerprints of the person we are seeking. So too, we find in the Gospel a record of the fingerprints or marks of the true Church as Christ established it. The chief marks are unity, holiness, universality and apostolicity. And when we look for these marks or fingerprints among all the churches which claim to be established by Christ, we find that the marks are found in only one of these churches-the Catholic Church.
    
- These marks are not the only proofs we have that the Catholic Church is the one true Church of Jesus Christ. We have another convincing argument in the many miracles that have always been wrought in the Catholic Church, in support of the Church's doctrines or at the intercession of a saint or a holy person. For example, in recent times many sick persons have been cured at the shrine of the Blessed Virgin Mary at Lourdes in France, in a manner that could not have been produced naturally. These must be wrought by God as a special favor to His Mother and to the Church which venerates her. Now, the God of truth would not work miracles for a false religion, and so the Catholic religion in whose favor these miracles take place must be true. Again, the fact that the Church has survived all kinds of obstacles and persecutions for almost twenty centuries is a proof that the Catholic Church is the Church of God; since any merely human organization would have perished long ago.
    
- Besides the marks, the Church has certain important attributes or qualities-authority to command its members, indefectibility or permanence; and, above all, infallibility in its official teachings. The claim of the Catholic Church to possess infallibility meets with great opposition from the enemies of the Church; yet, anyone who believes that Christ is truly God must admit that He can give the teachers of the Church a special protection whereby they are preserved from teaching error, and the Gospel clearly indicates that He willed to do so. This privilege of infallibility is possessed in the first place by the Pope, in whom the fullness of the teaching power resides; but it is present also in the bishops, not individually but as a group united with the Pope.
    
- One of the attributes of the Catholic Church which is much misunderstood is the necessity of the Church for salvation. The doctrine of the necessity of the Church does not mean, as some non-Catholics claim, that everyone who dies without being an actual member of the Church will be lost for all eternity. It means that Our Lord Himself made His Church a necessary means for salvation for all men, in such wise that a person must be joined to the Church at least by desire in order to be saved. Those who through no fault of their own do not realize that the Catholic Church is the one true Church of Jesus Christ, but try to serve God faithfully and love Him with their whole heart, will be saved, even though they are not actual members of the Church, because they are joined to the Church by implicit desire. But such persons are deprived of many graces which they would receive as members of the true Church. Speaking of those outside the Catholic Church, Pope Pius, in his Encyclical on the Mystical Body, said: "From a heart overflowing with love we ask each and every one of them to be quick and ready to follow the interior movements of grace and to look to withdrawing from that state in which they cannot be sure of their salvation. For even though unsuspectingly they are related to the Mystical Body of the Redeemer in desire and resolution, they still remain deprived of so many precious gifts and helps from heaven, which one can enjoy only in the Catholic Church."
    
- Oftentimes Catholics are accused of intolerance; and in the United States, where personal rights are valued so highly, it is regarded as very wrong to be intolerant. Now, the truth is this: Catholics are intolerant toward doctrines opposed to the teaching of the Catholic Church; but they are tolerant toward the persons who hold those doctrines. Any intelligent person who examines this attitude of Catholics will admit that it is quite fair and reasonable.
    
- When we say that Catholics are intolerant toward doctrines opposed to the teaching of the Catholic Church, we mean that Catholics regard those doctrines as false. We must do this if we are honest. Since we are convinced that the Catholic religion is true and that it is the one religion established by the Son of God for all mankind, we logically hold that all other religions are erroneous, and that their existence is not in accordance with the will of Christ, who prayed that "there should be one fold and one shepherd." For this reason we try to persuade those who hold those false doctrines to examine the claims of the Catholic Church to be the one true Church of Christ.
    
- Catholics, however, are tolerant toward persons who hold false doctrines. In other words, we believe that we are obliged to show Christian charity to all such persons, to love them as our brothers and sisters, to aid them in their necessities. We should presume that they are honest and sincere in holding their religious beliefs, and we should pray that God may bless and enlighten them. Even if some of them are unkind to us and persecute us because we are Catholics, we should not manifest a like spirit of bigotry toward them.
    
- It is indeed a great privilege to belong to the one true Church. Hence, it is one of the best works of Catholic Action for Catholics to try to persuade their non-Catholic friends to study the arguments for the truth of the Catholic religion. And Catholics themselves can never sufficiently thank God for the favor of being members of the true Church. They should remember the sublime teaching of St. Paul that the Church is a living body with Christ as its Head. "You are the body of Christ, member for member" (1 Cor. 12:27). Just as each member of the body receives vital power from the head, so we, if we are living members of the Church-that is, if we retain in our souls the life of grace-are constantly receiving supernatural power and vigor from Christ, our Head.

## Lesson 13: The Communion of Saints and Forgiveness of Sins `(Sự Hiệp thông của các Thánh và Sự Tha tội)`

> "I BELIEVE IN ... THE COMMUNION OF SAINTS, THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS ... "

### Q. 170. What is meant by "the communion of saints" in the Apostles' Creed?

**A.** By "the communion of saints" is meant the union of the faithful on earth, the blessed in heaven, and the souls in purgatory, with Christ as their Head.

- The blessed in heaven comprise the Church triumphant; the souls in purgatory, the Church suffering; and the faithful on earth, the Church militant.

> `"It is therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead, that they may be loosed from sins" (2 Machabees 12:46).`

> `"In him (Christ Jesus) the whole structure is closely fitted together and grows into a temple holy in the Lord; in him you too are being built together into a dwelling place for God in the Spirit" (Ephesians 2:21-22).`

> `"... Rendering thanks to the Father, who has made us worthy to share the lot of the saints in light" (Colossians 1:12).`

> `"But you have come to Mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to the company of many thousands of angels, and to the Church of the firstborn who are enrolled in the heavens, and to God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of the just made perfect, and to Jesus, mediator of a new covenant" (Hebrews 12:22-24).`

### Q. 171. Through the communion of saints, what can the blessed in heaven do for the souls in purgatory and the faithful on earth?

**A.** Through the communion of saints, the blessed in heaven can help the souls in purgatory and the faithful on earth by praying for them.

- The prayers of the blessed in heaven are always efficacious because they are always in accord with God's will.

> `"When thou didst pray with tears, and didst bury the dead, and didst leave thy dinner, and hide the dead by day in thy house, and bury them by night, I offered thy prayer to the Lord" (Tobias 12:12).`

> `"And there was given to him much incense, that he might offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which is before the throne" (Apocalypse 8:3).`

### Q. 172. Should the faithful on earth, through the communion of saints, honor the blessed in heaven and pray to them?

**A.** The faithful on earth, through the communion of saints, should honor the blessed in heaven and pray to them, because they are worthy of honor and as friends of God will help the faithful on earth.

- Many saints have special feast-days. All the saints are honored on the Feast of All Saints, November 1.

> `"Let us now praise men of renown, and our fathers in their generation" (Ecclesiasticus 44:1).`

### Q. 173. Can the faithful on earth, through the communion of saints, relieve the sufferings of the souls in purgatory?

**A.** The faithful on earth, through the communion of saints, can relieve the sufferings of the souls in purgatory by prayer, fasting, and other good works, by indulgences, and by having Masses offered for them.

- Mass can be frequently offered for the repose of a soul. There are special Requiem Masses for the day of the funeral, the thirtieth day after death or burial, and the anniversary of the death or burial. On All Souls' Day, November 2, Masses are offered for all the souls in purgatory.
- Most indulgences granted by the Church are applicable to the poor souls in purgatory. A plenary indulgence can be gained by the celebration of Mass at a privileged altar. This indulgence can be applied only to the soul in purgatory for whom the Mass is offered.
- Bishops and other prelates designated in the Code of Canon Law can determine and declare one altar, in churches specified by law, as privileged daily and perpetually, under the conditions prescribed by the Sacred Canons.
- All Masses celebrated at any altar on All Souls' Day, and during its octave, and during the Forty Hours' Devotion enjoy the same privilege as those offered on a privileged altar, but only in favor of the soul for whom the Mass is said.

> `"It is therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead, that they may be loosed from sins" (2 Machabees 12:46).`

### Q. 174. Can the faithful on earth help one another?

**A.** The faithful on earth, as members of the Mystical Body of Christ, can help one another by practicing supernatural charity and, especially, by performing the spiritual and corporal works of mercy.

- Prayer, one of the spiritual works of mercy, is of value not only for the living but also for the dead. The other spiritual works of mercy and most of the corporal works are concerned primarily with the living.

> `"Then the king will say to those on his right hand, 'Come, blessed of my Father, take possession of the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave me to eat; I was thirsty and you gave me to drink; I was a stranger and you took me in; naked and you covered me; sick and you visited me; I was in prison and you came to me.' Then the just will answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see thee hungry, and feed thee; or thirsty, and give thee drink? And when did we see thee a stranger, and take thee in; or naked, and clothe thee? Or when did we see thee sick, or in prison, and come to thee?' And answering the king will say to them, 'Amen I say to you, as long as you did it for one of these, the least of my brethren, you did it for me' "(Matthew 25:34-40).`

> `"By this will all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another" (John 13:35).`

> `"I urge therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions and thanksgivings be made for all men" (1 Timothy 2:1).`

> `"Pray for one another that you may be saved. For the unceasing prayer of a just man is of great avail" (James 5:16).`

***The Mystical Body of Christ***

- This picture shows the Communion of Saints. The assembly of the Angels and Saints in Heaven, the faithful on earth, and the souls in Purgatory are all shown.
    
- On top, the Angels and Saints adore the three Persons of the Trinity and pray to them for the faithful who still live on earth. In the middle, the faithful on earth assist at the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, where they invoke the Saints in Heaven, pray for each other, and ask for the deliverance of the Poor Souls from Purgatory. At the bottom are the souls in Purgatory. The refreshing waters which two Angels pour upon them symbolizes the relief which the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass obtains for them.
    

### Q. 175. What is meant in the Apostles' Creed by "the forgiveness of sins?"

**A.** By "the forgiveness of sins" in the Apostles' Creed is meant that God has given to the Church, through Jesus Christ, the power to forgive sins, no matter how great or how many they are, if sinners truly repent.

- The Church exercises the power to forgive sin when sins committed before the reception of Baptism are forgiven by that sacrament; but especially does the Church exercise this power in the sacrament of Penance.

> `"He therefore said to them again, 'Peace be to you! As the Father has sent me, I also send you.' When he had said this, he breathed upon them, and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit; whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained' " (John 20:21-23).`

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT THE COMMUNION OF SAINTS AND FORGIVENESS OF SINS

- We all desire, particularly in times of sorrow, to have loving friends. The Catholic doctrine of the communion of saints teaches us that we can have many good friends at all times. The word "communion," as we use it in this connection, has nothing to do with Holy Communion. It means "society" or "union." And the word "saints" does not mean merely those who are in heaven with God. It means all who are joined to Christ by sanctifying grace. In a word, the Catholic doctrine of the communion of saints means that we have millions of' friends, bound to us by the supernatural ties of sanctifying grace and divine charity flowing from Jesus Christ, the Head of this society.
    
- These friends are: first, those living on earth with sanctifying grace and charity in their souls; these make up the Church militant, so called because its members are still engaged in the spiritual warfare against the world, the flesh and the devil, hoping to be victorious and to win the crown of eternal life; second, the souls in purgatory-those who have left this world in the state of grace but must still make atonement to God for a debt of temporal punishment; these make up the Church suffering; third, the saints in heaven, called the Church triumphant, because they have won the victory and are now enjoying their triumph with God for all eternity.
    
- These friends aid us in our needs, especially our spiritual necessities. There are many devout persons on earth who pray for us every day, even though we have never met them. The saints in heaven, particularly those to whom we pray, aid us also by their prayers. Above all, the Mother of God, the Queen of Saints, is praying for us before the throne of her Son, because she loves every soul for which He died, since she loves Him so much. The souls in purgatory probably pray for us also, although this is not entirely certain. The Church never prays publicly to the suffering souls, asking for their prayers, but she allows her members to do this privately, if they wish.
    
- There are millions of saints in heaven, but only certain ones have been canonized, or officially declared by the Church to be in heaven. When the Church canonizes a saint, we have absolute certainty that this person is in heaven, for the Church is infallible in canonizations. We can also be sure that baptized children who die before they reach the age of reason- perhaps members of our own family-are in heaven, and we can invoke them in our private devotions. The saints in heaven help in a particular way those who were dear to them in life and those who ask their prayers.
    
- But if the communion of saints brings us advantages, it also brings us obligations. We should pray to our friends, the saints in heaven; we should pray for our friends, the souls in purgatory. Toward those members of the communion of saints who are still in this world we must exercise charity, not only by praying for them but also by assisting them whenever they are in need either of body or of soul, especially through the corporal and spiritual works of mercy. We must not consider their natural traits, which may be unpleasant, but must rather view them as sharers in the divine life that flows from Christ, and as persons who are destined to be our companions for all eternity in His kingdom. If we put into practice in this manner the doctrine of the communion of saints, we shall never be lonely or sad, even though all our worldly friends turn against us.

## Lesson 14: The Resurrection and Life Everlasting `(Sự Phục sinh và Sự Sống Đời đời)`

> "I BELIEVE IN ... THE RESURRECTION OF THE BODY, AND LIFE EVERLASTING."

### Q. 176. What is meant by "the resurrection of the body?"

**A.** By "the resurrection of the body" is meant that at the end of the world the bodies of all men will rise from the earth and be united again to their souls, nevermore to be separated.

- No man knows when the world will end. The signs preceding the destruction of the world, as given in Scripture, are: wars, famine, pestilence, the coming of Antichrist, the darkening of the sun and moon, and the appearance of the cross in heaven.

> `"But immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give her light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven will be shaken. And then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven; and then will all tribes of the earth mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming upon the clouds of heaven with great power and majesty. And he will send forth his angels with a trumpet and a great sound, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other" (Matthew 24:29-31).`

> *`(See also Romans 8:11).`*

### Q. 177. Why will the bodies of the just rise?

**A.** The bodies of the just will rise to share forever in the glory of their souls.

- During their earthly life the bodies of the just were the temples of the Holy Ghost; they were the instruments of the good acts by which the souls of the just merited eternal life. Respect should be shown for the bodies of the faithful departed; special burial places should be set aside for them, and their graves should be blessed.
- After the resurrection the bodies of the just will be in a glorified state. There will then be no need for food and drink to preserve the body, which will be endowed with qualities it did not possess in this life.

### Q. 178. Has the body of any human person ever been glorified and taken into heaven?

**A.** By the special privilege of her Assumption, the body of the Blessed Virgin Mary, united to her immaculate soul, was glorified and taken into heaven.

- This question emphasizes human person because the Divine Person, Jesus Christ, in His human nature has risen from the dead, glorious and immortal, and ascended into heaven (question 98).
- Since she was free from all sin, both original and actual, it was most fitting that the Blessed Virgin Mary should be preserved from the consequences of sin; the corruption of death and the deferment of glory until the last day. Moreover, since the Son of God took His flesh and blood from the chaste body of Mary, it was most appropriate that her body shall be glorified as soon as her earthly life was ended. From the early centuries, the doctrine of Mary's bodily glorification and assumption was accepted by the Church as contained in Christian Tradition. It was declared a doctrine of divine-catholic faith by Pope Pius XII on November 1, 1950. The Feast of the Assumption is celebrated on August 15.
- It is not certain whether the Blessed Virgin Mary first died and was shortly afterward taken into heaven, in body and soul, or was preserved from death and taken immediately to heavenly glory when her life on earth was ended. Pope Pius XII refrained from making a decision on this question when he issued his solemn definition of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin.

### Q. 179. Why will the bodies of the damned also rise?

**A.** The bodies of the damned will also rise to share in the eternal punishment of their souls.

- Since the body is the instrument of the soul in committing sin, it is just that the body also share in eternal punishment.

### Q. 180. What is the judgment called which will be passed on all men immediately after the general resurrection?

**A.** The judgment which will be passed on all men immediately after the general resurrection is called the general judgment.

- The general judgment was described by Our Saviour Himself. Every deliberate thought, word, deed, and omission of every person's entire life will be manifested at the general judgment. The Lord Christ will be the judge.

> `"For the Son of Man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will render to everyone according to his conduct" (Matthew 16:27).`

> `"Then the king will say to those on his right hand, 'Come, blessed of my Father, take possession of the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave me to eat; I was thirsty and you gave me to drink; I was a stranger and you took me in; naked and you covered me; sick and you visited me; I was in prison and you came to me.' Then the just will answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see thee hungry, and feed thee; or thirsty, and give thee drink? And when did we see thee a stranger, and take thee in; or naked, and clothe thee? Or when did we see thee sick, or in prison, and come to thee?' And answering the king will say to them, 'Amen I say to you, as long as you did it for one of these, the least of my brethren, you did it for me.'`
> 
> `"Then he will say to those on his left hand, 'Depart from me, accursed ones, into the everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry, and you did not give me to eat; I was thirsty and you gave me no drink; I was a stranger and you did not take me in; naked, and you did not clothe me; sick, and in prison, and you did not visit me.' Then they also will answer and say, 'Lord, when did we see thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to thee?' Then he will answer them, saying, 'Amen I say to you, as long as you did not do it for one of these least ones, you did not do it for me.' And these will go into everlasting punishment, but the just into everlasting life" (Matthew 25:34-46).`

> `"And he charged us to preach to the people and to testify that he it is who has been appointed by God to be judge of the living and of the dead" (Acts 10:42).`

### Q. 181. What is the judgment called which will be passed on each one of us immediately after death?

**A.** The judgment which will be passed on each one of us immediately after death is called the particular judgment.

- The existence of the particular judgment is apparent from the parable of Lazarus and Dives, which shows that one soul was rewarded and another punished immediately after death. Reward or punishment follows the sentence of judgment.
- The sentence of this judgment is final and will not be reversed. The particular judgment will be given immediately after the soul leaves the body. The soul will go at once either to its reward in heaven or to its punishment in purgatory or hell.

> `"For it is easy before God in the day of death to reward everyone according to his ways. The affliction of an hour maketh one forget great delights: and in the end of a man is the disclosing of his works" (Ecclsiasticus 11:28-29).`

### Q. 182. If everyone is judged immediately after death, why will there be a general judgment?

**A.** Although everyone is judged immediately after death, it is fitting that there be a general judgment in order that the justice, wisdom, and mercy of God may be glorified in the presence of all.

- Man is a social being as well as an individual. The general judgment will manifest God's Providence, the majesty of Christ, and the glory of the elect.

> `"Then shall the just stand with great constancy against those that have afflicted them and taken away their labors. These seeing it, shall be troubled with terrible fear, and shall be amazed at the suddenness of their unexpected salvation. Saying within themselves, repenting, and groaning for anguish of spirit: These are they whom we had some time in derision and for a parable of reproach. We fools esteemed their life madness and their end without honor. Behold how they are numbered among the children of God, and their lot is among the saints. Therefore, we have erred from the way of truth, and the light of justice hath not shined unto us, and the sun of understanding hath not risen upon us. We wearied ourselves in the way of iniquity and destruction, and have walked through hard way: but the way of the Lord we have not known. What hath pride profited us? Or what advantage hath the boasting of riches brought us? All those things are passed away like a shadow, and like a post that runneth on" (Wisdom 5:1-9).`

### Q. 183. What are the rewards or punishments appointed for men after the particular judgment?

**A.** The rewards or punishments appointed for men after the particular judgment are heaven, purgatory, or hell.

### Q. 184. Who are punished in purgatory?

**A.** Those are punished for a time in purgatory who die in the state of grace but are guilty of venial sin, or have not fully satisfied for the temporal punishment due to their sins.

- There will be no purgatory after the general judgment. Since we do not know how long individual souls are detained in purgatory, there is need for persevering prayer for the repose of the souls of all those who die after reaching the use of reason, except those who are canonized or beatified by the Church. The souls in purgatory are certain of entering heaven as soon as God's justice has been fully satisfied.

> `"The fire will assay the quality of everyone's work: if his work abides which he has built thereon, he will receive reward; if his work burns he will lose his reward, but himself will be saved, yet so as through fire" (1 Corinthians 3:13-15).`

### Q. 185. Who are punished in hell?

**A.** Those are punished in hell who die in mortal sin; they are deprived of the vision of God and suffer dreadful torments, especially that of fire, for all eternity.

- The souls in hell are beyond all help. They do not belong to the Mystical Body of Christ or to the Communion of Saints. They are not included among our neighbors and are not the objects of charity. They are doomed to the company of the devils for all eternity.
- The souls in hell do not have supernatural faith. They believe, however, in the truths revealed by Almighty God, not with divine faith, but because they cannot escape the evidence of God's authority.
- The privation of the beatific vision is called the pain of loss; the torment inflicted by created means on the soul, and on the body after its resurrection, is called the pain of sense.
- It is not against God's mercy to punish souls in hell for eternity. God's justice demands that He thus punish those who, sinning gravely and refusing to repent, deliberately turn themselves from God, their last end. The punishment of hell is eternal; Our Lord referred to it as "everlasting fire."

> `"Then he will say to those on his left hand, 'Depart from me, accursed ones, into the everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels' " (Matthew 25:41).`

> `"Indeed it is just on the part of God to repay with affliction those who afflict you, and to give you who are afflicted rest with us at the revelation of the Lord Jesus, who will come from heaven with the angels of his power, in flaming fire, to inflict punishment on those who do not know God, and who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. These will be punished with eternal ruin, away from the face of the Lord and the glory of his power, when on that day he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be marveled at in all those who have believed (2 Thessalonians 1:6-10).`

### Q. 186. Who are rewarded in heaven?

**A.** Those are rewarded in heaven who have died in the state of grace and have been purified in purgatory, if necessary, from all venial sin and all debt of temporal punishment; they see God face to face and share forever in His glory and happiness.

- The happiness of heaven consists in the beatific vision and the consequent joy of the blessed. This happiness is not postponed to the end of the world but begins as soon as all venial sin and the temporal punishment for sin have been remitted.
- The body participates in this happiness only after the resurrection at the end of the world. The blessed rejoice in the company of Our Saviour, the Blessed Virgin Mary, all the angels and saints, and the friends they knew on earth who have attained the reward of eternal life. There is no sorrow or pain in heaven; the joy is complete, though unequal, throughout all eternity.

> `"Then the king will say to those on his right hand, 'Come, blessed of my Father, take possession of the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world' " (Matthew 25:34).`

> `"Now this is everlasting life, that they may know thee, the only true God, and him whom thou hast sent, Jesus Christ" (John 17:3).`

> `"But, as it is written, 'Eye has not seen nor ear heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man, what things God has prepared for those who love him' " (1 Corinthians 2:9).`

> `"We see now through a mirror in an obscure manner, but then face to face" (1 Corinthians 13:12).`

> `"We know that, when he appears, we shall be like to him, for we shall see him just as he is" (1 John 3:2).`

> `"And there shall not enter into it anything defiled, nor he who practices abomination and falsehood" (Apocalypse 21:27).`

### Q. 187. What is meant by the word "Amen" with which we end the Apostles' Creed?

**A.** By the word "Amen" with which we end the Apostles' Creed, is meant "So it is," or "So be it;" the word expresses our firm belief in all the doctrines that the Creed contains.

- Our Divine Saviour frequently used this term to emphasize His teaching.

> `"Amen I say to you, I have not found such great faith in Israel" (Matthew 8:10).`

> `"Amen I say to you, unless you turn and become like little children, you will not enter into the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 18:3).`

### IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT THE RESURRECTION AND LIFE EVERLASTING

- We know that we must all die. When, where and how we shall die is uncertain; but that one day our soul will depart from our body, and that our body will then return to the dust of earth, we are absolutely certain. The all-important question is "What will take place after death?" St. Paul tells us: "It is appointed unto men to die once but after this comes the judgment" (Hebr. 9:27). Our Catholic faith assures us that we shall appear before God twice to be judged for the deeds of our lifetime. The first occasion occurs the very first moment after death in the very place where we die. Then, in a single instant our entire life will be examined by the all-knowing, all-just God, and the sentence given that will determine our eternal abode. The soul will be sentenced to eternal punishment if it is defiled by the guilt of mortal sin; if it is free from all sin and from the debt of temporal punishment it will be admitted at once to the joys of heaven; if it is adorned with the supernatural life of sanctifying grace but is in venial sin or is still burdened by a debt of temporal punishment, it will go to purgatory until full satisfaction is made and it is made worthy of the presence of God. The souls in purgatory are often called the faithful departed. God punishes these souls, not in a spirit of vengeance, but because He loves them and wills that they be fully purified so that they can be admitted to His presence.
    
- This is the particular judgment, and here the fate of the soul is determined unchangeably. But it often happens that the justice and the wisdom of God are hidden from the eyes of men in the present world. Those who lead good lives frequently have many trials to endure, while those who freely transgress God's law prosper. The question may arise in the minds of some: "How can God be just and good and wise, if He allows these things?" And so, in order that all men may see that God is all-just, and may understand that in the next life, if not in this, every one receives what is his due, there is a final or general judgment, conducted by Our Blessed Lord. He Himself describes this in an inspiring passage recorded in the twenty-fifth chapter of the Gospel according to St. Matthew, beginning with the words: "When the Son of Man shall come in his majesty, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory; and before him will be gathered all the nations" (Matthew, 25:31-32). Before the judgment, every human being that has ever lived will rise from the dead-that is, the body of every member of the human race will be formed again from the elements of the earth into which it passed after death and will be reunited to its soul, and then in the presence of the entire human race every individual will be judged, and will hear the sentence either of eternal reward or of eternal punishment. With the aid of our body and its senses we did either good or evil; and so, our body will share our happiness or our misery for all eternity.
    
- Every one of us therefore will spend eternity either in heaven or in hell. The most important task of life is to win heaven. To do this the one condition is that we have the state of sanctifying grace when we leave this world. We must expend every effort to avoid mortal sin. If ever we have the misfortune to commit a mortal sin, we must strive to receive pardon as soon as possible, by making an act of perfect contrition with the intention of going to confession.
    

### RESOLUTION

- Resolve to examine your conscience every night before retiring as if you were in the presence of Our Lord at the last judgment; and make an act of perfect contrition for all the sins of the day with the intention of confessing them, particularly if you have been so unfortunate as to commit mortal sin.

The first Friday of every month sees Amanda at the Communion rail. She receives also every Sunday. She is a victim of chronic rheumatism, and barely gets along on the small pay she receives from Cordelia. Sometimes Amanda is tempted to give up the struggle to be good, the devil suggesting the thought: "How can your God be good and wise, if He allows you to suffer and your mistress to prosper?
